// THE GATE SWEEP — the complete set, and the check that it stays complete.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE "ALL GATES GREEN" WAS REPORTED REPEATEDLY ABOUT A LIST
// THAT DID NOT INCLUDE ALL THE GATES. There was no sweep. There was a habit: a
// dozen script names carried from one commit message to the next, re-typed by
// hand each time. Two gates went red inside it without anyone noticing:
//
//   allocation-grid            threw on every run from dd2af19 to 440fab0, a
//                              whole commit, and was found only because the
//                              next commit happened to touch the code it calls
//   cession-path-independence  has been failing since 858f9ba at WC -8.8% and
//                              was found only because someone ran it by hand
//
// Neither was caught by the thing that is supposed to catch them, because the
// thing that is supposed to catch them was a memory.
//
// ⚠ THE MANIFEST IS CHECKED AGAINST THE DIRECTORY, AND THAT IS THE LOAD-BEARING
// PART. Listing the gates fixes today's omission; asserting that every file in
// scripts/diagnostics/ appears in exactly one of the lists below is what stops
// tomorrow's. A new gate that nobody adds here fails this runner on its first
// run, by name. Adding a script to PROBES is a deliberate act with a reason
// next to it, not an oversight.
//
//   npx tsx scripts/gates.ts             the fast tier — run this every commit

// FAST — the tier that runs on every commit. 52 gates, 18 minutes of CPU and a
// MEASURED 5m59s of wall clock at 3-way concurrency.
//
// ⚠ MEMBERSHIP IS DECIDED BY TIER_THRESHOLD_SECONDS, NOT BY JUDGEMENT, and the
// manifest check enforces it. See that constant for how the boundary was
// derived; the short version is head/tail breaks on the measured distribution,
// which put it at 88 seconds.
//
// ⚠ FOUR OF THESE WERE SITTING IN PROBES WITH A BROKEN EXIT PATH, not with
// nothing to say. gl-claim-check, gl-cutover-check, reinsurance-tower-check and
// wc-cutover-check each collect a problems[] and print FAIL per row, and each
// used to end on a console.log and exit 0 — so this runner printed `ok` beside a
// script that had just printed FAIL. Promoted here rather than renamed: two of
// them had their assertions deliberately STRENGTHENED while in PROBES (962ef60,
// cb00971) and one printed "-12.75% FAIL" into a commit message, so they were
// built and used as gates throughout.
//
// ⚠ THE SPLIT IS BY MEASURED COST, NOT BY IMPORTANCE, and nothing in SLOW is
// less load-bearing than what is here. SLOW now names what deferring each of
// its gates costs, because a tier assignment recording only a runtime is how a
// gate's value gets forgotten.
//
// ⚠ AND THE COST WAS NOT WHERE REPUTATION PUT IT — TWICE. cohort-stock-check
// runs SIXTY YEARS and takes 4 seconds, because it runs 4 games. Meanwhile
// cession-path-independence sat in this tier at 1015 seconds — 30% of its whole
// CPU — for as long as nothing measured it. The threshold exists because the
// second of those is the one that repeats.

// The two CLF grid derivers had not been: gl-clf-grid-derive was killed at 55
// minutes during that same concurrent timing pass and left in PROBES with a
// note saying "do not put it in a tier", so its cost was never established and
// nothing ever ran it. An unmeasured script is worse than a retirable one —
// nobody knew what it said.
//
// MEASURED, STANDALONE ON AN IDLE BOX: gl-clf-grid-derive 702s (11m42s), exit
// 0, "All monotonicity checks pass". That is a seventh of the 55-minute figure,
// which is not a contradiction — 55 minutes was three-way concurrent against
// property-tower-mc's Monte Carlo — but the standalone number is the one a tier
// should be sized on, and at 12 minutes it tiers cleanly.

// ⚠ BOTH DERIVERS BELONG HERE, AND "IT IS A GENERATOR" WAS NEVER THE REASON TO
// EXCLUDE THEM. Each ends in `process.exitCode = anyNonMonotonic ? 1 : 0` and
// prints "*** NON-MONOTONICITY DETECTED — DO NOT SHIP ***", so both have
// pass/fail semantics — the only test in this repo of whether a derived CLF
// grid is monotonic in percentile. The caveat that survives is one of SCOPE,
// not of kind: they assert monotonicity on the grid they PRODUCE, not on
// STATIC_CLF_TABLE, which is what the engine actually prices off. Keep that
// distinction; it is the reason these are not in FAST beyond their cost.
// (Checked while moving them: the early `exitCode = 1` stratification stop sits
// in an if/else-if/else chain, so the monotonicity branch cannot reach it and
// reset a real failure to 0.)

// WHAT THE FIRST COMPLETE RUN FOUND, at 440fab0 on feature/payout-patterns.
// Recorded here rather than only in a commit message, because a commit message
// is what the previous arrangement relied on.
//
// 33 of 35 gates green. Two red, NEITHER of them opened by the commit that
// built this runner, and both left standing deliberately at the time.
//
// ⚠ BOTH ARE GREEN NOW, AND NEITHER WAS FIXED BY MAKING THE ENGINE AGREE WITH
// THEM. Kept here in full because the diagnosis is the useful part and because
// the shape recurred: in both cases the GATE was wrong, not the engine.
//   the parity gate was passing two arguments to a three-argument function
//     (bcc0dcb), and its section 1b was asserting something that cannot be true
//     (5b27451)
//   cession-path-independence was asserting a TOTAL that is the sum of an
//     exactly-path-independent component and an inherent one, at a sample size
//     that could not resolve either (this commit)
//
//   cession-path-independence   WC -8.9%, 95% CI [-6.44M, -2.42M], excludes
//                               zero. Failing since 858f9ba. This is the
//                               PERVERSE-INCENTIVE gate — squeezed funding
//                               recovering a different amount from default
//                               funding means the funding decision moves total
//                               cession. It needs bisecting across the branch
//                               and that is its own commit.
//
//                               RESOLVED at 04e71ad / this commit: the bisect
//                               landed on a POWER boundary, not a break. The
//                               gate now asserts the inception component as an
//                               equivalence test at GAMES=300 and reports the
//                               development component, which is inherent.
//
//   panel-engine-parity-check   2 checks failed, WC ONLY — GL and Property are
//                               exact to 0.00e+0. The panel's quoted components
//                               disagree with the engine's on WC (pure premium,
//                               net pure premium, pool premium rate, admin rate,
//                               member charge), and against the engine's STORED
//                               fields it is 6,356x the exposure-rounding bound.
//                               That is not rounding.
//
//                               ⚠ IT IS NOT THE MEMBER-MOVEMENT GAP. Section 2
//                               of that script measures the panel-quotes-before-
//                               movement residual and says in its own prose that
//                               it "is NOT a defect"; the failures are in
//                               sections 1 and 1b, which are pre-movement and
//                               should match exactly. Reading the 2-CHECKS-FAILED
//                               line together with the nearest prose gets this
//                               wrong, and did on the first pass here.
//
//                               WC-only points at the WC severity and CLF work,
//                               but which commit is a bisect and its own job.
//
// ⚠ AND A THIRD WAS FOUND BY BUILDING THE LIST, WHICH IS THE POINT.
// panel-engine-parity-check was not in the habitual sweep and nobody knew it
// was red. It had been mentioned in six commit messages, so it is not obscure —
// it simply was not on the list anyone re-typed.
//
// ⚠ THREE GATES HAD NO EVIDENCE OF EVER HAVING BEEN RUN since the commit that
// introduced them: export-number-format-check (8723bd8), pool-market-share-check
// (f0a43c7) and trend-memoization-check (875cb75). No commit message other than
// the one that added them names them. All three pass today. The proxy is weak —
// a script can be run without being written about — but "no gate in this
// directory has NEVER run" is now true by construction rather than by hope.
//
// ⚠ AND "RUN" IS NOT "EXERCISED" — RESOLVED FOR THOSE THREE AT 2a051bb. Whether
// a gate has been TESTED is a question about whether the code it watches ever
// MOVED under it, and that is answerable from history rather than from commit
// prose. Measured, against each one's actual subject rather than its whole
// import graph:
//
//   export-number-format-check   EXERCISED. Six commits since 8723bd8 touched
//                                claimsExport/resultsExport, including a new
//                                sheet section (5c3d9cc) and the paid split
//                                (3ee8ba8). Green across real column changes.
//   trend-memoization-check      BARELY. One commit (cb00971) touched
//                                memoizeByYear; none of the five trend
//                                functions it guards has been edited since.
//   pool-market-share-check      NOT EXERCISED. The pool marketShare formula
//                                has not been touched since f0a43c7 added the
//                                gate for it. 35 commits of green on a subject
//                                that never moved is not evidence.
//
// ============================================================================
// gl-clf-grid-derive IS NO LONGER UNMEASURED. It ran to completion at 2a051bb:
// 702s standalone, exit 0, "All monotonicity checks pass", with the analytic CV
// inside the bootstrap CI and the denominator identity at 8.88e-16. It has moved
// to SLOW with that runtime stated — see SLOW's note. The old text here said it
// was "in no tier because a tier containing it would never be run"; a script in
// no tier is one that never runs at all, which is strictly worse, and the
// 55-minute figure it was excluded on turned out to be concurrency.
// ============================================================================

// ============================================================================
// CAN-FAIL EVIDENCE — WHAT EACH NEVER-FIRED GATE DOES WHEN ITS SUBJECT BREAKS.
//
// 24 of 40 gates had never gone red. That is the absence of evidence, not
// evidence of soundness, so each was put through the method this project uses on
// every new gate: perturb the thing it claims to watch with a PLAUSIBLE defect,
// confirm it goes red, revert. Full table in the commit message; the outcomes
// that change how a reader should treat a gate are recorded here.
//
// 22 of 24 FIRE ON A PLAUSIBLE DEFECT. One is a smoke alarm. One cannot fire.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ TWO GATES WERE DELETED HERE, AND THIS IS WHERE THEIR COVERAGE WENT.
// Written down so nobody re-adds them on the strength of the name.
//
// pool-market-share-check  DELETED at this commit. It reimplemented BOTH the
//   old exposure-sum formula and the new premium-weighted one locally and
//   asserted the year-1 gap between its own two functions. The engine's
//   pool-scope marketShare — simulationEngine's totalMemberCharge-weighted mean
//   of each line's own share — was never read, so it could not fire. Measured:
//   re-weighting the engine by poolPremium left it green, and FORCING THE FIELD
//   TO ZERO left it green.
//
//   WHERE THE COVERAGE IS NOW, all three verified against that same zeroing:
//     pool-aggregation-check   FAILS and names marketShare by field
//                              ("Property-solo pooled row differs from its only
//                              line at marketShare"). This is the real guard —
//                              it asserts the pooled row against the line rows,
//                              which is the property the deleted gate was
//                              gesturing at.
//     audit-formula-check      FAILS with 640 findings; the audit page's Market
//                              Share row is one of them, and this gate has
//                              caught that row wrong TWICE before (118b1fb,
//                              ebdb147).
//     value-identity-check     reports VALUES MOVED.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ TWO MORE GATES WERE RETIRED AT THE PER-CLAIM FLIP, AND THIS IS WHERE THEIR
// COVERAGE WENT. Both were PROVED GREEN ON THE NEW MECHANISM FIRST — the
// argument that per-claim revision has no routing choice is the reason to
// retire them, but the argument alone was not accepted as the evidence.
//
// development-sign-symmetry  RETIRED. It asserted that adverse and favourable
//   movements cede at the same MARGINAL rate under the engine's own stochastic
//   routing. Run at this commit with the flag ON: green, WC 1.06x, GL 1.04x,
//   Property 1.05x against its own tolerance. Its subject was the free-lunch
//   surface created by a ROUTING CHOICE — a movement could be allocated to the
//   developing set or proportionally, and the choice could be made to differ by
//   sign. The per-claim law has no such choice: every claim's delta is its own
//   revision, so there is nothing left to route and the surface closes by
//   construction rather than by assertion.
//
//   WHERE THE COVERAGE IS NOW:
//     cession-uplift-basis     holds the DOLLAR statement over complete cohort
//                              lives, which the retired gate's own closing text
//                              named as the stronger claim and explicitly
//                              deferred to.
//     development-cession-check holds allocateDevelopment's invariants directly,
//                              including both modes and the spill.
//     cohort-ledger-check      holds the three ledger identities on BOTH arms.
//
//   ⚠ WHAT IS GENUINELY GIVEN UP, stated rather than glossed: nothing now
//   asserts sign-symmetry of the COHORT arm's stochastic routing. That arm is
//   still reachable (it is the flag-off control) but is no longer a shipped
//   path, so the property is no longer a property of the played game.
//
// allocation-grid            RETIRED. A probe, not a gate — it asserted nothing
//   and printed a rule-by-rule cession table quoted in developmentAllocation.ts.
//   Run at this commit with the flag ON: exit 0, table intact. It compared
//   ALLOCATION RULES (largest-3, sizeWtd-3, sizeWtd-10, proportional) against
//   each other, and the shipped path now selects none of them for the stochastic
//   step. development-cession-size remains in PROBES and prints the cession rate
//   by rule for anyone who needs that comparison again.
//
// ============================================================================
// clf-downside-check       DELETED at this commit. Its only assertion was
//   combinedAt1 = (1 + adminRatio + reinsPct) / (1 + adminRatio + reinsPct)
//   over three hardcoded admin ratios and four hardcoded reinsurance
//   percentages. That is X/X: `worst` is exactly 0 for every input and the
//   "FAIL — formula has drifted" branch is unreachable. It read no engine
//   value, so there was nothing to perturb.
//
//   WHERE THE COVERAGE IS NOW: ratio-basis-check asserts the same property
//   against the REAL engine — expectedCombinedRatio === 1.0000 exactly at
//   CLF 1.000, held at 1e-12 on all three lines AND on the pool aggregate,
//   worst observed departure 2.22e-16 over 360 line-years. It fires: putting
//   the loss numerator back on the gross basis reports 12 mismatches.
//   The MEASUREMENT half of the deleted file — the downside distribution over
//   50 games — was never gated and is not replaced; investment-dominance-report
//   and loss-level-diagnostic cover that ground as readings.
//
// ⚠ NEITHER DELETION REMOVED AN ASSERTION FROM THE REPO, because neither file
// contained one that could fail. That is the bar for deleting a gate here: not
// "something else also looks at this", but "this file asserted nothing, and
// here is the file that asserts it, and here is the perturbation that proves it".
// ============================================================================
//
// ⚠ funding-expected-check's HEADLINE ASSERTION IS A TAUTOLOGY, THOUGH THE
// SCRIPT IS NOT. Section 1 claims "Expected produces CLF = exactly 1.000" and
// implements it as `const wcExpectedClf = 1.0; assert(wcExpectedClf === 1)` —
// its own comment says "the literal engine short-circuit, nothing to compute".
// Measured: changing the engine's Expected dispatch to 1.001 leaves it green.
// Section 4 is real and load-bearing — collapsing WC's four held class rates to
// one pooled rate fails it at 1.73e-1 — so the script stays, but nothing in the
// repo asserts that the Expected path returns exactly 1.
//
// ⚠ enrolment-independence-check CARRIES TWO DEAD ASSERTIONS, and this is the
// OTHER cause of cannot-fire: the subject is gone, not the assertion broken.
// Its printed WX and WXevent columns are `note(true, ...)` — hardcoded passes
// left behind when the weather band moved inside the fitted severity mixture at
// 645c15e. Confirmed: no weather draw remains anywhere in src/. The file's own
// header says the test must come back if a cat band ever reintroduces shared
// within-event draws; until then these two columns print OK about nothing.
// The rest of the gate is sound and fires — see below.
//
// ⚠ property-tower-mc IS A SMOKE ALARM ON ITS DISCRETISATION AXIS, and its
// resolution is now measured rather than assumed. Coarsening the Panjer lattice
// 8x (BIN $25k -> $200k, the exact regression a person writes chasing its 21
// minutes) moves Panjer's worst mean error 4.70% -> 5.67% against an 8% bound
// and PASSES. At 80x ($2M) it fails at 42.67%. So it catches a gross lattice
// defect and would miss a 2x-to-8x one. Its OTHER assertions — the sign-
// stability of the error, and Panjer beating the lognormal comparator — are not
// on that axis and are not characterised here.
//
// ⚠ AND THREE PERTURBATIONS THAT DID NOT FIRE WERE MY MISTAKE, NOT THE GATE'S.
// Recorded because the distinction is the whole method:
//   enrolment-independence-check  dropping the member id from GL's key but still
//     building the rng per member gives every member an IDENTICAL stream, which
//     is position-INdependent — so the gate correctly reported independence. The
//     real coupling shape is ONE stream hoisted out of the member loop, and on
//     that it fires.
//   funding-basis-check  moving the admin RATIO 0.15 -> 0.14 is a level change;
//     assertion 5 is about the BASIS. Moving admin onto the net pure premium
//     fails 3 checks.
//   trend-memoization-check  making memoizeByYear call fn(key) rather than
//     fn(year) is a no-op while all five functions floor internally. Making one
//     of them stop flooring — the hazard its header names — fires it.
// A gate that does not fire on the wrong perturbation has not been tested yet.
// ============================================================================

// ============================================================================
// THE TIER BOUNDARY IS A MEASURED NUMBER, AND IT IS DERIVED RATHER THAN PICKED.
//
// ⚠ A THRESHOLD CHOSEN BY JUDGEMENT IS HOW THE NEXT SLOW GATE LANDS IN FAST THE
// WAY cession-path-independence DID. It sat in FAST at 1015s — 30% of that
// tier's whole CPU — because nothing said it could not.
//
// DERIVED BY HEAD/TAIL BREAKS, which is the standard method for a heavy-tailed
// distribution: take the mean, keep what is above it, repeat. On the 65 measured
// runtimes:
//
//   round 1   n=65   mean  88s   13 gates above it
//   round 2   n=13   mean 357s    3 gates above it
//   round 3   n= 3   mean 934s    2 gates above it
//
// The first break is the boundary: 88 seconds. It reproduces the reading the
// table gives by eye — a dozen gates carrying most of the cost above a long
// cheap tail — without anyone choosing where the dozen stops.
//
// ⚠ A SECOND DERIVATION WAS TRIED AND REJECTED, and the reason matters. The
// largest RATIO gap in the sorted runtimes is 2.45x (830s -> 339s), with nothing
// else above 1.38x; its geometric mean gives 530s. That finds the biggest cliff
// in the distribution — but the cliff is not where the cost is. At 530s only one
// gate moves and FAST lands at 13.1 minutes of wall clock; at 88s nine move and
// it lands at 6.1. A boundary that identifies a real feature of the data and
// does not solve the problem is still the wrong boundary.
//
// ⚠ AND A THIRD WAS VACUOUS, recorded so it is not re-derived. "A gate longer
// than FAST's own wall clock IS the wall clock" is self-consistent and sounds
// principled: solve tau = max(sum/P, max). It never binds here, because the
// tail is long enough that sum/P exceeds the largest gate at every cut. It
// would bind on a set with one dominant gate and few others.
// ============================================================================

/**
 * Recorded runtimes, seconds per gate, from a full FAST+SLOW sweep.
 *
 * ⚠ RECORDED RATHER THAN MEASURED IN PLACE, BECAUSE MEASURING IS CIRCULAR. To
 * know whether a gate belongs in the tier that runs it, you would have to run
 * it — which is the cost the tier exists to avoid. So the manifest check reads
 * a committed figure.
 *
 * ⚠ WHICH MEANS THE FIGURE CAN GO STALE, AND TWO THINGS KEEP IT HONEST:
 *
 *   the manifest check      fails if a FAST gate's RECORDED time is over the
 *                           threshold, and fails if a gate has no recorded time
 *                           at all. A new gate cannot enter FAST unmeasured.
 *   the full sweep          measures everything anyway. `--all --record-timings`
 *                           rewrites this file from that run, and the merge-time
 *                           sweep is where a gate that got slower is caught.
 *
 * So the recorded figure gates ADMISSION cheaply and the real measurement gates
 * DRIFT at merge. Neither alone is sufficient: the recorded one cannot see a
 * gate that grew, and the measured one is too expensive to consult per commit.
 *
 * ⚠ RUNTIMES MOVE WITH MACHINE AND LOAD, so the threshold is not a tight
 * tolerance and should not be read as one. 88s against a gate measured at 96s is
 * a real signal; 88s against one measured at 90s is noise, and the remedy there
 * is to re-record rather than to reshuffle tiers.

  //   1st entry — "all four fail". FALSE. The gate short-circuited at NOT BUILT
  //     and printed 0/4, which is four conditions NEVER REACHED. Reading it as

  // ⚠ AND GREEN IS NOT PERMISSION TO SHIP — BUT ONE FLAG NOW HAS SHIPPED.
  // FORWARD_BOOKING went on at the maturation-book commit; PRICING_TRIANGLE has
  // not, and its reason is a design question rather than a mechanism one. The
  // gate still asserts conditions 3 and 4 with BOTH on, so condition 4's arm is
  // a state nobody runs. If this gate goes red again, it is a regression in the
  // loop and not a calibration drift.
  // ⚠ maturity-anchor-check IS OUT OF THIS MAP — it went green at the commit that
  // derived TRIANGLE_OPEN_SHARE. Gross climb against 1/c now reads WC -2.0%,
  // GL -3.0%, Property +3.9%, from +3.3% / +26.4% / +35.1%. No constant was
  // fitted: g is untouched and the fix is the open-share curve plus dropping the
  // now-redundant horizon truncation. If it goes red again that is a regression
  // in the booking mechanism, not calibration drift.
  // ⚠ ratemaking-loop-check IS OUT OF THIS MAP AGAIN, and this time condition 3
  // is PAIRED. It re-entered for one line: Property read 67.9% against a 75%
  // absolute bar once the open-share curve removed the +35.1% overshoot that
  // had been earning it 94%. The bar was not moved. The STATISTIC was replaced
  // — flagged minus shipped on the same seeds and the same line-years,

  // reads 88.2% positive at p 9.2e-9; WC 90.0% at 6.4e-16; GL 91.0% at 1.3e-16.
  // Two null controls run every time and BOTH must stay silent: the arm paired
  // with itself, and two runs of the null arm on disjoint seeds (57.8% / 50.0%
  // / 41.3% positive, p 0.09 / 0.54 / 0.91). A control that fires fails the
  // gate. See WORKING_PRACTICES on the paired lesson's fourth appearance — the
  // first where paired is not cheaper but is the only estimator that works.
  // ⚠ clf-label-backtest-check IS OUT OF THIS MAP AND THE MECHANISM FIXED IT.
  // Its entry said the worst label error was +14.5pp with FORWARD_BOOKING off and
  // +14.7pp with it on, that "the flip is NOT the cause", and that the fix was to
  // re-derive all three CLF tables against the shipped mechanism. The first two
  // were true. The third was wrong, and measurably: at the maturation-book commit
  // the worst error is GL at the 50% stop, -3.2pp against a 5pp tolerance, on 960
  // line-years per line. No table was re-derived and GL still reads GL_SUPPLIED.
  //
  // What changed is what the tables were being asked to describe. A three-year
  // book under a mean-one law put realised confidence a long way from its label;
  // ten accident years of runoff under forward booking put it back. So the
  // provenance concern stands as a provenance concern and is no longer a defect
  // anyone can measure — and the note that the funding slider's percentages were
  // "labels on a distribution nobody is drawing from" is retired: they are labels
  // on the distribution the pool is now actually drawing from.
  //
  // ⚠ AND IT CAME BACK ON GL, THEN TURNED OUT TO BE THE GATE'S OWN BASIS. The
  // retraction above was measured on the gate's FIRST statistic, loss over a
  // pooled mean. Its replacement divided by each year's own premium and reported
  // -21.9pp on GL. That number was real arithmetic and the wrong comparison: it
  // scored an ACCIDENT-YEAR curve against a CALENDAR-YEAR statistic. Measured on
  // the same accident years, GL's accident-year ratio has CV 0.4168 against the
  // supplied curve's implied 0.3979, and its calendar-year ratio 0.1936 — the
  // calendar basis blends up to eight open accident years at different ages and
  // halves the spread. The gate now measures settled accident-year ultimate and
  // GL reads -0.5 to +1.7pp from the 70% stop up. Both earlier figures are kept
  // above as what those statistics reported, not as measurements to rely on.
  //
  // ⚠ TWO ROUTES WERE MEASURED AND REJECTED ON THAT WRONG NUMBER, which is the
  // reason this history is written out rather than trimmed. Putting GL_DERIVED
  // in force scores -16.2pp pooled on the corrected basis against GL_SUPPLIED's
  // -8.8pp, worst exactly where players fund for margin. Raising GL's frequency
  // cannot work in principle: frequency only lowers CV and the gap needs it to

      + 'accident-year — GL_SUPPLIED carries a fatter low tail than this model produces, confined to the '
      + 'deliberate-underfunding end; unchanged in kind. (3) PROPERTY +10.8pp on the small band, '
      + 'calendar — NEW, and new because it is now GATED rather than because it appeared. It was 223 obs '
      + 'against MIN_BAND_N 250 and therefore reported-but-not-asserted; the fifth arm lifted it to 804. '
      + 'Property is derived at 88+ against a default book of 66, a TWO-band mismatch, and over-delivers '
      + 'monotonically from the 85% stop down, so a player choosing deliberate under-funding gets more '
      + 'safety than the label promises. WHAT RETIRES EACH: (1) a book-size axis, or accepting it as the '
      + 'price of an honest default; (2) a GL curve with a different low tail; (3) re-deriving Property '
      + 'at the small band, which is a ruling not yet taken. ORIGINAL ENTRY FOLLOWS. '
      + '⚠ THE RESIDUAL THIS ENTRY DESCRIBED HAS MOVED, AND THE ENTRY IS CORRECTED RATHER THAN LEFT. '
      + 'It named WC -7.2pp on the SMALL band; after the membership work (departures off, pre-game roster '
      + 'frozen, No New Business default) WC reads -4.0pp there and the live failure is +13.0pp at the '
      + '55% stop on the LARGE band. Same mechanism, opposite end: WC\'s single curve has a book-size '
      + 'LEVEL effect and the book moved, so the error moved with it. Worst per band, each line on its '
      + 'own gated basis — WC (calendar) -4.0 / +7.6 / +13.0, GL (accident) -12.4 / -10.1 / -8.0, '
      + 'Property (calendar) +20.7 (thin, ungated) / -3.1 / +3.8. ⚠ DO NOT RE-DERIVE ON THE STRENGTH OF '
      + 'THIS: the default book (~62) and an Open-appetite book (~113) now BRACKET the derivation band, '
      + 'so every available re-derivation trades one player\'s accuracy for another\'s. clfTables.ts '
      + 'carries the measurement and the declined re-derivation. GL\'s 30%-stop residual stands '
      + 'unchanged. WHAT RETIRES THIS ENTRY: a book-size axis, or a ruling that one trajectory is the '
      + 'one to serve. ORIGINAL ENTRY FOLLOWS. '
      + 'TWO REAL RESIDUALS, ON THE BASIS EACH LINE IS ACTUALLY GATED AGAINST. This entry used to '
      + 'describe reds that were DEFINITIONAL — every line was scored on accident-year ultimate while '
      + 'two of the three tables are calendar-year percentiles, so WC and Property could not pass and '
      + 'nobody read their reds. The gate now gates each line on the basis its own table was derived '
      + 'on: GL accident-year, WC and Property calendar-year, both bases printed for all three. '
      + 'WHAT IS LEFT IS ACTIONABLE, and it is these two: '
      + '(1) GL -11.6pp at the 30% stop on the large band, accident-year. GL_SUPPLIED carries a '
      + 'fatter LOW tail than this model produces, so the bottom of the slider promises more '
      + 'under-funding than the book delivers. Confined to the deliberate-underfunding end — from the '
      + '70% stop up GL reads -0.5 to +1.7pp, which is what carried the basis change. '
      + '(2) WC -7.2pp on the SMALL band, calendar-year, and it is a BOOK-SIZE LEVEL EFFECT rather '
      + 'than a mis-shaped curve. WC\'s calendar mean ratio runs 1.042 / 1.035 / 1.025 across small / '
      + 'mid / large, and the worst error tracks it at -7.2 / -2.2 / -1.2. A small book runs a 1.7% '
      + 'higher loss ratio, so its distribution sits higher and fewer of its years fall under the low '
      + 'stops. A single curve with no book-size axis cannot carry that by construction — clfTables.ts '
      + 'records that decision and its measured cost, and this is the same cost seen from the gate. '
      + '⚠ SEPARATELY, AND NOT A DEFECT: WC and Property KEEP their calendar-basis tables. That is a '
      + 'ruling taken at 73b0ab8 with the numbers in front of it — re-deriving WC onto accident-year '
      + 'raises every off-Expected stop 3.2% to 6.0% for cost the player never sees land in five games '
      + 'out of six (only 16.4% of WC accident years written in a ten-year game reach their own runoff '
      + 'horizon), and Property\'s indicated curve moves only -2.6% to +4.0%. Do not re-derive either '
      + 'on the strength of this entry. '
      + '⚠ AND THE RULING HAS A VISIBLE COST THE GATE NOW PRINTS: GL\'s curve describes accident years '
      + 'while WC\'s and Property\'s describe calendar years, so "75% confidence" does not mean quite '
      + 'the same thing per line while the slider carries identical words on all three. '
      + 'WHAT RETIRES THIS ENTRY: closing either residual. The GL one needs a curve with a different '
      + 'low tail; the WC one needs a book-size axis, which was considered and rejected because it '
      + 'makes the rate move as the book moves. Neither is a re-derivation anyone can just run.',
