// MEMBER VALUE — WHAT THE MONEY BOUGHT, AND WHAT THE TERM IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO.
//
// Eight sections, and three of them exist to keep a RULING checkable rather than
// recorded in a comment. That distinction is this repo's recurring lesson: the
// level weight's derivation went stale behind a comment and was only caught when
// the gate was made to assert it, and the join-draw width was corrected three
// times by its own gate.
//
//   1. THE POTS ARE LAYERS AND THEY ARE EXHAUSTIVE. With a control that fails on
//      the claim-size banding this replaced.
//   2. IT FEEDS NOTHING. Static allow-list over src/, the same instrument
//      member-satisfaction-check uses and for the same reason.
//   3. POOL AGAINST MARKET at defaults, per line, with a priced-up control.
//   4. MEMBER AGAINST POOL rebases to 1 on the book, by construction.
//   5. THE TOWER IS DISCLOSED AND NOT RATED, and the row shape enforces it.
//   6. THE LOWER BOUNDARY BUYS NOTHING — the rejection, re-measured every run.
//   7. retainedAboveTower IS NOT THE SOURCE, and reads 0 while real dollars sit
//      above the tower. A trap recorded as a test.
//   8. THE POOL'S ONE-YEAR RATIO IS LUCK, which is why the reported window
//      matters. Asserted against what pure noise would give.
