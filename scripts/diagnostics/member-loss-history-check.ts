// ROLLING MEMBER LOSS HISTORY CHECK — stage 3 of the experience-modifier work.
//
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/member-loss-history-check.ts
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THIS GUARDS.
//
// PoolState.memberLossHistory keeps a rolling per-member, per-line record of
// actual and expected loss, marketplace-wide, so the experience modifier
// (stage 4) has something to read — including for prospects. It is accumulated
// as it happens and never regenerated, because recomputing a past year's
// expectation later would evaluate it at the member's CURRENT risk quality and
// make a member whose RQ improved look retroactively favourable.
//
// FOUR WAYS THIS CAN BE WRONG, ALL OF THEM QUIET:
//
//   1. THE ASYMMETRY SILENTLY SYMMETRISED. k_line must be INCLUDED in the
//      stored expected (it is a pool pricing artifact, so it must cancel in the
//      modifier); risk control must be EXCLUDED (so safety investment earns a
//      favourable mod, as NCCI experience rating does). Getting either wrong
//      biases every enrolled member's mod by a couple of percent — small,
//      systematic, and sign-flipping as the roster mix drifts. Asserted here
//      against kLineApplied, which stage 2 exposed for exactly this purpose.
//
//   2. PROSPECTS RATED ON POOL TERMS. Prospects generate at k = 1 and rc = 0,
//      so both their legs must be unadjusted. If k leaked in, a non-member's
//      history would depend on the enrolled book's RQ mix.
//
//   3. A Map INSTEAD OF A RECORD. The whole GameState goes through
//      JSON.stringify in App.tsx, where a Map serialises to {} SILENTLY. The
//      round-trip check below is what catches that class of mistake.
//
//   4. THE STORE TOUCHING THE DRAW PATH. Recording happens in processYear after
//      processLineYear returns, so it is downstream of every draw. That is
//      verified by value-identity-check and solo-export-guard, not here — but it
//      is the reason those two must stay green across this change.
//
// PROPERTY IS ENROLLED-ONLY AND THAT IS EXPECTED, NOT A GAP IN THE STORE.
// ⚠ AND NOT FOR THE REASON THIS HEADER USED TO GIVE. It said Property "still
// runs the legacy aggregate path"; it has not since its claim generator
// landed — simulationEngine calls generatePropertyClaims like the other two,
// and the aggregate path is now dead for all three lines (the engine says so
// at the branch). The real reason is narrower: the Property branch generates
// no PROSPECTS, so it leaves marketMemberLossResults undefined and the store
// sees only the enrolled book. Property gains marketplace coverage when that
// branch grows a prospect call, not when a cutover happens.
// Reported explicitly below so the asymmetry is visible rather than mistaken for
// a bug in the accumulation.
