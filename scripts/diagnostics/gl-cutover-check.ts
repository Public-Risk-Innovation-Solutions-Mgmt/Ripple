// ⚠ THE 66.8% ANALYTIC-RATIO ASSERTION WAS DELETED HERE. It was the identical
// construction to wc-cutover-check.ts's, read 139.21% on GL, and sat behind the
// same `process.argv[2] === '6b'` branch that scripts/gates.ts has no mechanism
// to pass. Dead code, never run in a sweep, could not have been.
//
// THE FULL RECORD IS IN wc-cutover-check.ts's HEADER and is not duplicated here,
// because two copies of a derivation are how the 0.39-versus-0.1254 band-width
// error in opening-centring-check survived. In brief: 66.8% is
// gross / (gross x 1.346 + 0.15 x gross), a GROSS-FUNDED pool at the old
// 75%-confidence default; funding is net now and the default CLF is 1.000, so
// neither input survives. Correct at the cutover, drifted in two steps —
// a21d01b took the CLF default to 1.000 and d80aa9e moved the expected loss
// ratios onto the net basis.
//
// TO RESTORE IT: divide by x.totalMemberCharge instead of
// x.poolPremiumAndAdminExpense, drop the argv branch, and keep the 0.668 target
// unchanged. The denominator was excluding reinsuranceCost while the numerator
// was gross — and reinsurance is exactly what makes gross differ from net.
//
// ⚠ AND NOTHING NOW CHECKS THE LOADING STRUCTURE on either line. See the
