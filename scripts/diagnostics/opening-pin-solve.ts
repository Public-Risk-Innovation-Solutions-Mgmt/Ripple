// RE-SOLVE STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM — a generator, not a check.

//
// Writes nothing. Prints a pin per line; paste it into defaultAssumptions.ts by
// hand and re-run opening-centring-check.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM has now drifted THREE times
// — 995f6f9 (28.7% off), the payout-pattern change, and this one. The first two
// were found by accident; the third was found by opening-centring-check, which
// is the gate doing its job. What did not exist either time was a way to re-solve
// it that anyone could just run, so each re-solve was rebuilt from the header's
// prose. This is that tool.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ BISECT. DO NOT FIT A SLOPE. The constant's own header records a secant being
// tried and thrashing on GL — 0.5007 -> 0.2543 -> 0.0665 -> 0 -> 0.1097, never
// reaching the target — and says why: the objective is a MEDIAN of N noisy
// draws, so a secant differentiates noise, and near the floor the curve is
// non-monotone (pin 0.0665 read 0.271 against pin 0 reading 0.280).
//
// ⚠ AND THE AFFINE FITS IN THAT HEADER ARE SUPERSEDED TWICE OVER, which is worth
// saying because they are the obvious thing to reach for. `surplus/premium ~
// 0.2059 + 2.1214 K` and its two siblings were measured (a) against an earlier
// engine and (b) on the PREMIUM basis. WC and GL are now RESERVE-anchored — see
// OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND — so a Newton step off those fits solves the wrong
// objective with the wrong slope. Property is still on premium and is the only
// line those fits could still describe.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ SOLVE THROUGH THE GATE'S OWN ESTIMATOR, AND THIS IS THE LESSON THAT COST A
// PASS LAST TIME. The first re-solve used a private 64-instance harness, landed
// GL at 0.1659, and opening-centring-check rejected it at -5.4 SE: the gate
// reads 400 seeds through simulateLineCandidate and measured 0.408 where the
// harness had measured 0.502. A pin solved against a different estimator than
// the one that asserts is a pin that fails its own gate.
//
// So this file calls simulateLineCandidate directly, at attempt 0 with no
// rejection, through openingBandRatio — the same three calls opening-centring-
// check makes, in the same order, on the same setup shape.
//
// ⚠ ON AN INDEPENDENT SEED BASE, THOUGH. Solving on the gate's own seeds would
// fit the gate's own sampling noise and produce a pin that passes by
// construction rather than because it is centred. This uses its own prefix and
// stride; the gate then verifies on seeds this solver never saw. Agreement
// across the two is the evidence, and disagreement is a finding rather than a
// nuisance.
//
// ⚠ AND THE OBJECTIVE IS THE UNFILTERED MEDIAN, not the accepted one. Centring
// on the accepted sample is a fixed-point iteration against the band's own
// selection: the accepted set is confined to the band by construction, so it
// looks centred however far the underlying distribution has moved.
// opening-centring-check's header records that measured both ways.
