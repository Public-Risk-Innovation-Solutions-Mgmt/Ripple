// NET FUNDING BASIS — this is what guards it.
//
// Run: npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/funding-basis-check.ts
//
// The pool premium now funds NET expected loss: gross pure premium less the
// expected ceded of the layers ACTUALLY PLACED (plus the WC/Property
// aggregate's own expected ceded), before the CLF is applied. All three lines
// net now — Property joined as of its own occurrence layer and aggregate.
//
// THE ASSERTIONS THAT MATTER:
//
//  1. poolPremium / (expectedLoss - expectedCeded) == CLF exactly. Under the old
//     gross basis this ratio was CLF against expectedLoss itself.
//  2. The underwriting identity still holds EXACTLY: at defaults,
//     underwritingIncome == poolPremium - netIncurredLoss. What changes is not
//     the identity but its expectation.
//  3. E[underwriting income] at CLF 1.000 is now ~ZERO rather than ~E[ceded].
//     This is the whole point: the pool no longer banks the ceded portion.
//  4. Declining layers RAISES the pool premium, because their expected ceded
//     stays in. A layer's net cost to members is its RISK LOAD alone.
//  5. Admin is unchanged and still on the GROSS expected loss.
//
// Reported, plus hard assertions where the quantity is bounded.
