// APPLICATION RATE DERIVATION, AFTER THE TARGET CAME OUT — A PROBE. Measures
// and prints; asserts nothing and always exits 0.

//
// ⚠ THE RATE IS BEING RE-DERIVED AGAINST A DIFFERENT JOB. The 6% that shipped
// was derived against one condition — make the appetite tiers grade, by leaving
// a strict bar short of a fixed quota. That was the right question while the
// book was held level by MEMBERSHIP_EQUILIBRIUM_ENROLLMENT and a flat intake
// cap. Both are deleted. With the outlet open the rate no longer fills a quota;
// it SETS THE BOOK'S TRAJECTORY, and a number calibrated for tier grading has
// no reason to be right for that.
//
// THE QUESTIONS NOW:
//   1. Can a pool that accepts everyone grow meaningfully over ten years?
//   2. Can a picky one shrink to the point where it is a problem?
//   3. Is either the accident of a constant, or the consequence of a decision?
//   4. Does the capacity guard bind, and if so throughout or only early?
//   5. ⚠ Does a growing book look more profitable than it is?
//
// Question 3 is answered by WHERE the trajectory settles, not whether it
// settles — see membership-flows-report for the crossing arithmetic. A plateau
// at the crossing is two flows meeting. A plateau near 63 is the deleted target
// still acting.
//
// Question 5 is the one to watch hardest. Forward booking understates incurred
// while a book is YOUNG, because the development of older years has not yet
// arrived to offset the under-booking of the newest. A permanently growing book
// is permanently young — each cohort larger than the runoff behind it — so the
// understatement never clears. Section 6 measures it as a RATIO rather than
// through the surplus, because surplus is where it shows and the ratio is where
// it is.
