// ⚠ SEED COUNT IS A PRECISION PARAMETER, NOT A STYLE CHOICE, and this script
// was WRONG about that on its first version. It validated across 8 seeds at
// 30,000 trials each and reported a 2-18% Panjer "error" — but at Property's
// aggregate CV the per-seed Monte Carlo standard error on E[ceded] at the
// higher attachment is itself several percent, so the 8-seed spread was
// substantially sampling noise and NEITHER the headline error nor its
// apparent spread across levels meant anything. The defaults below are set so
// the reported MEAN error is resolved to well under the effect being measured,
// and the per-seed standard error is printed alongside every figure so the
// reader can see the resolution rather than trust it.
//
// What re-measuring properly then exposed: an 18% understatement at the higher
// attachment that was REAL and was this module's own defect — see section 0.

  // ==========================================================================
  // ⚠ SIGN STABILITY IS ASSERTED ONLY WHERE THE ERROR IS BIG ENOUGH TO NEED
  // CORRECTING. THE FIRST DIAGNOSIS OF THIS RED WAS WRONG AND IS RECORDED AS
  // WRONG.
  //
  // The rule is that a ONE-DIRECTIONAL error can be absorbed by a loading factor
  // and a SIGN-CHANGING one cannot. It went red when Property's default book
  // fell from ~120 to ~66 (No New Business as the default appetite, on a
  // pre-game roster that no longer moves).
  //
  // ⚠ THE FIRST READING WAS "L1'S ERROR WENT TO ZERO, SO ITS SIGN IS A COIN
  // TOSS". That is not what happened. At 200 seeds L1 reads -0.43% +/- 0.24 and
  // at 60 seeds -1.14% +/- 0.44 — consistent with each other and with a
  // genuinely negative error, not with zero. A significance test on the mean was
  // tried and rejected BECAUSE IT WAS ITSELF FRAGILE: it passed at 1.8 SE
  // against a 2 SE threshold at the shipped sample and failed at 60 seeds, which
  // is a gate whose verdict depends on how long you run it.
  //
  // SO THE ERROR REALLY IS SIGN-CHANGING NOW: +0.45% at L0, about -0.5% at L1.
  // What is false is that this matters. The check exists because a correctable
  // error can be loaded away; at half a percent THERE IS NOTHING TO LOAD AWAY,
  // and the file's own acceptance bound on the same quantity is 8%.
  //
  // ⚠ THE FLOOR IS THE PER-SEED MONTE CARLO SE, WHICH IS A RESOLUTION AND NOT A
  // TOLERANCE, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS STABLE ACROSS SAMPLE SIZES. A loading
  // factor sized to correct an error smaller than one seed's own MC standard
  // error could never be shown to have worked — the correction is unmeasurable
  // on the instrument that would have to validate it. Measured here: per-seed SE
  // is 0.77% at L0 and 2.25% at L1, against mean errors of 0.45% and 0.43%.
  // Both are under their own resolution at 200 seeds AND at 60, so the verdict
  // does not move with the run length.
  //
  // ⚠ DO NOT RAISE THIS FLOOR TO CLEAR A FUTURE RED. If a level's mean error
  // exceeds its own per-seed MC SE and two such levels disagree in sign, that is
  // the defect this check was written to catch and a loading factor cannot fix
  // it. Lower TRIALS raises the per-seed SE and would silently widen the floor —
  // which is why TRIALS is a shipped default and not a convenience knob.

  //
  // ⚠ SO IT WOULD MISS AN 8x COARSENING, AND THAT IS EXACTLY THE REGRESSION THIS
  // FILE INVITES. It runs 21 minutes and 63% of the fast tier's CPU, so the
  // change someone reaches for is a bigger lattice — and propertyAggregate's own
  // header records that the precision came FROM going "$200k down to $2k bins",
  // which reads as an invitation to go back. Reverting to $200k costs 1pp of
  // accuracy here and this gate would call it green.
  //
  // WHAT TO DO INSTEAD OF TIGHTENING THE BOUND: the 8% is not slack, it is the
  // NegBin moment-match plus the neutral-RQ severity basis, and lowering it
  // would fail on correct code. The lattice needs its own direct assertion —
  // Section 0 already measures discretisation bias against the closed-form
  // limitedExpectedValue and is the natural home for it. Not added here: this
  // commit records the resolution, it does not change the instrument.
