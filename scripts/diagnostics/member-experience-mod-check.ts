// THE MEMBER EXPERIENCE MODIFIER — A GATE.

// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:

//   GAMES=4 YEARS=6 npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/member-experience-mod-check.ts
//
// The modifier moves money BETWEEN members and must move nothing else. Five
// assertions, and three of them are about what it must NOT touch.
//
// ============================================================================
// 1. THE REBASE HOLDS: exposure-weighted mean mod is exactly 1.
//
// The cap moves the mean by construction — clamping a right-skewed ratio at
// [0.5, 3.0] pulls its mean well below 1 — and the rebase is what puts it
// back. So this is not a property to note, it is the one the cap creates a
// need for.
//
// ⚠ WITH A POSITIVE CONTROL, to the same standard as reserve-centring-check
// and for the same reason: a centring assertion that has never been shown to
// reject an off-centre input is not a centring assertion. A deliberate 5%
// off-balance is injected and must be rejected.
//
// 2. IT REACHES THE RATE ONLY THROUGH WHO IS ENROLLED, NEVER DIRECTLY.
//
// ⚠ THIS ASSERTION WAS REWRITTEN, AND THE OLD ONE WAS RIGHT WHEN IT WAS
// WRITTEN. It used to demand that scaling CREDIBILITY_Z left the enrolled
// roster, activeExposure, poolPremium and the rate ALL bit-identical — "the
// modifier reaches nothing but the split". That held while the modifier fed
// only the premium allocation.
//
// It is now false BY DESIGN. memberDeparture.ts reads the modifier: a member
// with better-than-average experience is more marketable and leaves sooner
// when the price rises. So changing Z changes who leaves, which changes the
// enrolled book, which changes activeExposure and therefore poolPremium.
// That is adverse selection, it is the pressure Renewal Underwriting exists
// to manage, and a gate forbidding it would forbid the feature.
//
// WHAT MUST STILL HOLD IS NARROWER AND IS THE PART THAT WAS EVER LOAD-BEARING:
// the modifier must not reach the RATE. The pool prices at NEUTRAL risk
// quality deliberately, and a modifier feeding into the rate would be
// finding 17 arriving through underwriting — a realized outcome repricing
// the line rather than moving money between members.
//
// ⚠ THE OBVIOUS TEST IS VACUOUS AND WAS TRIED FIRST. Comparing only the
// line-years where the two arms HAPPEN to enrol the same book self-selects:
// the books match exactly in the early years, when no member has three years
// of history, so no member is rated, so the modifier is 1 everywhere and
// there is nothing for the rate to leak. 60 of 180 line-years matched and the
// modifier moved in none of them.
//
// So the departure channel is CLOSED instead, by setting DEPARTURE.priceWeight
// to 0 in BOTH arms. Departure then reads no modifier at all and the roster
// is invariant to Z by construction, which restores the original strict
// comparison — the roster, exposure, pool premium and rate must all be
// bit-identical while the ALLOCATION moves. That isolates the pricing path
// from the selection path rather than hoping they separate on their own.
//
// A second clause then re-opens the channel and requires the departure RISK
// ORDERING to MOVE, because a closed-channel test alone would also pass if
// departure had silently stopped reading the modifier.
//
// ⚠ THAT SECOND CLAUSE ASSERTED THE ROSTER UNTIL VOLUNTARY DEPARTURES WERE
// SWITCHED OFF, AND IT WENT RED THE SAME DAY — CORRECTLY. With
// VOLUNTARY_DEPARTURES_ENABLED false nobody leaves at default decisions, so no
// perturbation can move the roster through departure and the clause was
// reporting exactly the thing it was built to report: the channel it asserts
// about has no observable outcome. It is re-pointed at the ORDERING, which
// departureRisks still computes every year off the modifier, rather than
// weakened or deleted. The same two cases are still distinguished — a departure
// model that stopped reading the modifier would not move the ordering either.
//
// ⚠ AND IT FAILS IF THE PERTURBATION MOVES NO ALLOCATION, the same
// inert-probe guard member-premium-check carries. A probe that cannot move
// the thing it perturbs is not a control.
//
// 3. IT CANNOT SEE THE YEAR IT IS PRICING.
//
// processYear records a year into the ledger AFTER processLineYear returns,
// so the mod for year N reads years N-3..N-1. Asserted by recomputing the mod
// from the ledger AS IT STOOD AT THE END OF YEAR N-1 and requiring a bit-exact
// match with what the engine used in year N — and, as its own control, by
// requiring that the same recomputation INCLUDING year N gives a different
// answer. Without that second clause the first would pass on a ledger that
// never changed.
//
// 4. THE MOD STAYS INSIDE THE BAND ITS CONFIGURATION ALLOWS.
//
// 5. UNRATED MEMBERS SIT AT EXACTLY 1. Not approximately: a member with too
// little history is not being rated, and a mod of 0.9997 would mean they were
// being charged for an opinion the design says it does not have.

 * ⚠ 16 AND NOT 10, AND THE REASON IS THE SAMPLE RATHER THAN THE SCOPE.
 *
 * The pooled drawn-vs-analytic primary share is gated at 1pp, and at 10 years it
 * read 1.13pp once the book was frozen at ~64 members — the estimate stopped
 * resolving the bound, not the invariant stopped holding. Measured at this
 * commit:
 *
 *     GAMES=6  YEARS=10   gap 1.13pp   FAIL      (the old default)
 *     GAMES=6  YEARS=16   gap 0.34pp   pass  29s
 *     GAMES=6  YEARS=20   gap 0.36pp   pass  32s
 *     GAMES=10 YEARS=10   gap 0.61pp   pass  38s
 *
 * ⚠ AND MORE YEARS IS THE CHEAP LEVER WHILE MORE GAMES IS THE DEAR ONE. Each
 * game pays for a ten-year pre-game before a single played year exists, so years
 * amortise that cost and games repeat it: 16 years at 6 games is FASTER than the
 * 10-year default was (29s against 33s) and resolves three times better than 10
 * games at 10 years.
 *
 * ⚠ RAISE THE SAMPLE, NEVER THE BOUND. 1pp is an invariant statement — the
 * drawn primary share must equal the analytic one because both limit at
 * EXPERIENCE_SPLIT_POINT. Widening it to admit 1.13pp would trade a statement
 * about the engine for a statement about the sample.

// ⚠ TWO DIFFERENT CLAIMS, AND THE SECOND IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE.
//
// EXHAUSTIVE: primaryActual <= actual, always, and the excess is the
// remainder. Nothing is discarded by the split — that is the whole answer to
// "capping throws away the large claim", and it is asserted rather than
// asserted-in-prose.
//
// MATCHED: the DRAWN primary share and the ANALYTIC primary share must agree
// per rating group. The generators limit each drawn claim at
// EXPERIENCE_SPLIT_POINT; the modifier divides by an expectation limited at
// the same point through `severityLimit`. That is invariant 1 — one basis for
// losses and pricing — applied to a new quantity, and if the two ever read
// different split points the modifier would divide a limited numerator by an
// unlimited denominator and hand every member a large credit. Nothing else in
// the codebase would notice.
//
// ⚠ NEAR-NEUTRAL MEMBERS ONLY, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT A BASIS CHECK. The
// analytic share is at NEUTRAL risk quality; the DRAW carries the
// risk-quality severity tilt, which is draw-only by invariant 2. So a member
// away from neutral has a drawn primary share that legitimately differs —
// measured over the whole book the gap reaches 3.3pp on highSafety, whose
// tilt is the largest in the model, and that gap IS the signal the modifier
// exists to read. Comparing the full book would therefore gate the tilt
// rather than the split point. Restricted to |RQ - 5| <= 0.5 the tilt is
// close to the identity and what is left is the basis.
//
// ⚠ PROPERTY IS EXCLUDED, NOT MERELY UNINTERESTING. primaryShare returns 0
// for Property by design (it is never rated), so an analytic share of 0.00%
// against a drawn 4.10% would sit inside any bound wide enough for the other
// lines and assert nothing. A meaningless comparison inside a passing bound
// is worse than no comparison.
