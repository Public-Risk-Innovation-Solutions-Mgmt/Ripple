// DERIVATION of the static CLF tables, MEASURED FROM THE ENGINE ITSELF.

//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS IS A BACKTEST AND NOT A MONTE CARLO.
//
// The previous grids were derived from a separate Monte Carlo of the annual
// loss distribution and then interpolated at runtime. Measured against the
// engine, WC's over-delivered at EVERY stop by about +3.5pp — a mismatch
// between the grid's model of the draw and the draw itself. Deriving from a
// second model and validating against the engine is exactly what produced that.
//
// This measures the engine. The pool runs at ALL-DEFAULT decisions, and for
// every line-year the realised retained loss is divided by the retained loss
// that was FUNDED. The percentiles of that ratio ARE the table, so any
// mismatch between model and engine is absorbed by construction — there is no
// model left to mismatch.
//
// ⚠ NO CIRCULARITY. At all-defaults fundingAtExpected is true, so CLF is pinned
// to exactly 1.000 and the grid is never consulted. The derivation run
// therefore does not depend on the table it produces.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE RATIO, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE.
//
//   ratio = netIncurredLoss / poolPremium
//
// DENOMINATOR: at CLF 1.000 the pool premium IS the expected retained loss.
// Since fab85e4, poolPremium = (grossExpected - expectedCeded) x CLF, so at
// defaults it equals E[retained] exactly — asserted in funding-basis-check.
// Using the published poolPremium rather than reconstructing E[retained] keeps
// the denominator identical to the one the CLF will actually multiply.
//
// NUMERATOR: netIncurredLoss, because that is the loss the P&L charges against
// the premium — underwritingIncome = poolPremium - netIncurredLoss is an exact
// identity at defaults. So "adequate at stop p" means precisely "underwriting
// income is non-negative p% of the time", which is the question the funding
// slider is asking.
//
// ⚠ NOT netUltimateLoss, and on WC the two genuinely differ. WC's
// grossUltimateLoss is the CALENDAR-year REPORTED loss (its own header says
// so): it carries prior-year emergence and excludes this year's delayed
// claims. netIncurredLoss is paid plus reserve movement, which is the
// accident-year view the premium is set against. Both are reported below so the
// gap is visible rather than assumed away; GL has no IBNR so they coincide
// there, which doubles as a check that the distinction is being read correctly.
//
// ============================================================================
// SAMPLE AND UNCERTAINTY. Line-years within a game are NOT independent — the
// book persists, and so does surplus. Confidence intervals are therefore a
// BLOCK bootstrap resampling whole GAMES with replacement, never individual
// line-years, which would understate the interval at every stop.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ RUN THIS TWICE. THE TABLE IS SELF-REFERENTIAL.
//
// Installing the table changes the engine it was measured from, via the 90%
// stop: reserveMarginCLF reads it, the Required Reserve Margin scales with it,
// and runPriorHistory accepted a pre-game only if the opening surplus landed
// inside OPENING_MULTIPLE_BAND x that margin. Measured, not assumed — the first
// pass gave a WC crossing of 49.9% and re-deriving with that table installed
// gave 47.2%.
//
// ⚠ THE LINK IS NOW CUT: the pre-game tests the opening against PREMIUM
// (OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND), so the 90% stop no longer reaches the
// opening surplus. Expect ONE pass to converge. Run it twice anyway and check —
// the cost is one run, and this loop is exactly the kind that comes back.
//
// So: derive, install, DERIVE AGAIN, and only ship once two consecutive passes
// agree. Anything else ships a table calibrated to an engine that no longer
// exists. GL barely moves between passes (68.8% -> 68.6% at the time); WC does, because its
// crossing sits where the density is highest and small shifts in the ratio
// distribution move it further.

//   BANDS=1 GAMES=500 npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/clf-table-derive.ts
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS NOW. The shipped table has no book-size dimension, and the
// file says why: "Since the membership equilibrium fix the enrolled book holds
// near 62 members". That fix is deleted. The book is an outcome now and the
// derivation sample itself has moved — measured, the solo run's median enrolled
// book is 87-93, not 62. So the question "which book is the table derived at"
// has an answer that changed without anyone choosing it.
//
// ⚠ AND BOOK SIZE IS CONFOUNDED WITH BOOK AGE IN A SINGLE TRAJECTORY, WHICH IS
// THE TRAP. At all-defaults the book climbs monotonically — WC runs 76 -> 92
// across the ten years — so "small book" is almost exactly "early year", and any
// difference between bands could be size OR age. Deriving from bands of one
// trajectory would measure the two together and attribute it to size.
//
// The appetite tiers break the confound. They produce genuinely different books
// AT THE SAME YEAR — below 0.75 shrinks while Accept All grows — so banding
// across arms gives book sizes that are not year labels. fundingAtExpected is
// still true on every arm, so CLF is still pinned to 1.000 and the derivation is
// still non-circular.
//
// This mode therefore samples ALL FOUR appetite arms, reports the ratio banded
// by book size WITH YEAR HELD so the confound is visible rather than assumed
// away, derives a candidate table from each band, and backtests every candidate
// across the whole range.

// ============================================================================
// BAND_DERIVE=<n> — produce a SHIPPABLE table from one band, with CIs.
//
// The band analysis above says which band to derive at; this writes that band's
// table out at full precision with a block bootstrap over whole games, which is
// the same interval the ordinary derivation reports and the reason the band rows
// carry their game id.
//
// ⚠ THE BLOCK IS THE GAME, NOT THE BAND-YEAR. Resampling band rows individually
// would treat ten years of one pool as ten independent observations; they are
// not, because a pool's book size and its loss experience both persist. So a
// bootstrap draw takes a whole game and then keeps whichever of its years fall
// in the band — which also means the band's row count varies between draws,
// exactly as it would between real pools.
