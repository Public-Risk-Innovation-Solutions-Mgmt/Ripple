// THE RATEMAKING LOOP — THE ACCEPTANCE TEST. Play a year; all four must hold.
//
//   1. the triangle the pool priced that year off now CONTAINS that year, age 1
//   2. the oldest accident year is GONE
//   3. every remaining accident year has developed one step, ON INCURRED
//   4. the next year is priced off the UPDATED triangle
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ WRITTEN BEFORE THE LOOP EXISTED, AND IT NOW PASSES 4/4 ON THE FLAGGED ARM.
// This gate is the deliverable's definition, not a report on a component. Four
// components had each passed their own gate while the loop stayed unbuilt, so
// this one was written first and made to pass last. It came out of EXPECTED_RED
// at the commit that built LinePoolState.pricingTriangle.
//
// ⚠ ONE FLAG NOW SHIPS AND ONE DOES NOT, SO READ THE ARMS CAREFULLY.
// FORWARD_BOOKING SHIPS as of the maturation-book commit: Property's 22%
// over-development was closed by the open-share curve, and the opening position
// it broke was fixed by giving the pool ten accident years of runoff rather than
// three — see MATURATION_YEARS. PRICING_TRIANGLE still ships OFF, and its reason
// is now a design question rather than a mechanism one: measured with
// investments off it removes the game's downside.
//
// So conditions 3 and 4 are asserted with BOTH on, which is a state nobody runs.
// Condition 3's arm is now the shipped mechanism; condition 4's is not. A green
// acceptance test is still not permission to flip PRICING_TRIANGLE.
//
// ⚠ IT REPORTS UNEVALUATED SEPARATELY FROM FAILED, AND THE DISTINCTION IS THE
// POINT. The first version asserted all four against LinePoolState.pricingTriangle,
// which does not exist, so it short-circuited at NOT BUILT and printed 0/4. That
// reads as four failures. It was four conditions never reached, and reading it
// as four failures cost two commits aimed at a mechanism blocker that was not
// there — condition 3's mechanism has worked since commit 1. A gate that cannot
// tell "this is broken" from "this was never run" is worse than one that fails.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ CONDITION 3 ASSERTS AGAINST reserveDevelopment, NOT pricingTriangle, AND
// THAT IS A RULING RATHER THAN A CONVENIENCE.
//
// The window seeds from LinePoolState.reserveDevelopment — the pool's own
// append-only ledger of accident years it actually wrote — and NOT from
// claimTriangle.ts's synthetic ten-year history. The two compound development on
// different clocks: the generator to each CLAIM's closure age, the engine to the
// COHORT's IBNER_HORIZON. Mixing them makes a chain ladder average an age-to-age
// pattern no book produces. reserveDevelopment opens as a proper staircase
// (ay-4 at age 1, ay-5 at age 2, ... ay-8 at age 5) and every factor in it —
// seeded rows included — is engine-produced, because runPriorHistory calls
// processYear. So the ledger is internally consistent end to end and the shape
// problem does not arise.
//
// ⚠ CORRECTED: "7-8 rows at game start, ten within two or three played years"
// was written here and in claimTriangle.ts and is wrong on both halves.
// Measured, flagged arm, 8 games: WC opens at 6.5 rows and reaches ten at
// PLAYED YEAR 4; GL 7.0 and year 3; Property 7.5 and year 3. So the window is
// short on every line for the first three years and shortest on WC — the pool
// prices off a PARTIAL window before it prices off a full one, which is a real
// property of the opening game rather than a warm-up to be papered over.
//
// Condition 3 is asserted against reserveDevelopment directly rather than
// against the projection, so it measures the ENGINE rather than the window.

// ============================================================================
// CONDITION 3 IS PAIRED, AND ON THIS GATE THAT IS NOT A TIGHTENING — IT IS THE
// ONLY ESTIMATOR THAT WORKS AT ALL.
//
// ⚠ THE FOURTH APPEARANCE OF THE PAIRED LESSON, AND THE FIRST OF ITS KIND.
// Cession bought 5x. M2 bought 5x. The climb instrument bought only 1.2x and
// that was CHECKED rather than assumed. Three times pairing was CHEAPER — the
// same question answered on less sample. Here an absolute test is IMPOSSIBLE,
// not merely expensive, and the distinction is worth having written down.
//
// ⚠ WHY NO ABSOLUTE BAR CAN WORK. A fixed bar must sit above the noise and
// below the signal. Once the drift is scaled by the open-share curve,
// Property's INTENDED steps are 1.137 / 1.052 / 1.025 at ages 1-3, while
// MATERIAL_FACTOR was 1.02 read off the shipped arm's own 95th percentile.
// There is no gap left to sit in: the smallest real signal and the noise floor
// are the same size. Property read 94% under the old engine and 67.9% under the
// fixed one — and the 94% was earned by developing value whose claims had
// closed, which is the +35.1% overshoot maturity-anchor-check now forbids. The
// gate was green BECAUSE of the defect.
//
// ⚠ PAIRING REMOVES THE NOISE RATHER THAN CLEARING IT. Same seeds, same
// line-years, both arms: the shipped arm IS the null for that exact cell. A
// 1.025 intended step against a paired null of 1.000 is a 2.5% signal on
// near-zero noise, not a 0.5% margin over a 2% floor. And the tuned constant
// disappears — the question becomes whether flagged minus shipped is positive
// more often than chance, which is a sign test and has no bar to pick.
//
// ⚠ SIGNIFICANCE, NOT A SHARE. PASS requires the one-sided sign test against
// p=0.5 to clear MAX_P. That is a stringent threshold rather than a
// conventional 0.05 because three lines are tested at once and because this
// repo's history is of under-powered readings believed too early. It is not
// tuned to the answer: it is the same number whatever the lines read.
//
// ⚠ AND IT MUST STILL FAIL WHERE THERE IS NO MECHANISM. The ORIGINAL condition
// 3 was a float inequality that passed 73.7% of SHIPPED line-years where
// nothing develops; the absolute bar fixed that; a paired version could fall
// into the same hole a third time. TWO CONTROLS RUN EVERY TIME:
//
//   SHIPPED vs SHIPPED, same seeds — the difference is identically zero, so no
//     cell is positive and the sign test cannot fire. Catches a statistic that
//     reads signal out of a pairing with itself.
//   SHIPPED vs SHIPPED, DISJOINT seeds — genuine noise with no mechanism in it.
//     The share positive must sit near 0.5 and the test must NOT clear MAX_P.
//     This is the control that would catch a one-sided estimator.
//
// Both are asserted, not merely printed. A control that passes fails the gate.
//
// ⚠ THE SCOPE CORRECTION FROM THE PREVIOUS COMMIT IS RETIRED, ON ITS OWN
// MERITS AND NOT BECAUSE PAIRING SUCCEEDED. It excluded steps whose own
// deterministic drift was under 1.02, because demanding a 1.02x move from a
// 1.012x intended step asserts against the mechanism. That incoherence was a
// property of the ABSOLUTE bar. A paired test is coherent for any positive
// intended step however small, so the correction now solves a problem the
// statistic does not have — and excluding cells would cost power and could hide
// a real failure at the ages where development is smallest.
