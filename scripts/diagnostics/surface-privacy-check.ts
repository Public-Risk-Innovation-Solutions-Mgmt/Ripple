// ============================================================================
// THE PRIVACY SURFACE — A GATE.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/surface-privacy-check.ts
//
// Risk quality is UNOBSERVABLE. A pool administrator sees a member's claims,
// their payroll and their renewal behaviour; they do not see a 1-10 score of
// how well the entity is run. The simulation keeps the attribute — the claim
// engines read it, member movement reads it (see membershipEngine.ts's note
// at the sort) — and the PLAYER does not.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY A GATE AND NOT A CODE REVIEW.
//
// Hiding an attribute is a one-commit act and keeping it hidden is not. The
// field is still on Member, still populated, still used by four engines, and
// `member.riskQuality` will keep compiling forever. The next page that wants
// "a quality indicator" will find it in autocomplete, and nothing but this
// file will object.
//
// THE ELEVEN SITES THIS WAS BUILT FROM, as they stood at the hide:
//
//   MembershipPage      sort-key union, sort comparator, column header,
//                       quality colour, the cell itself                (5)
//   ResultSpreadsheet   member-table column header, table cell,
//                       CSV header, CSV cell                           (4)
//   MembershipPage:78   pool AVERAGE — kept                            (1)
//   ResultsPage:285     pool AVERAGE — kept                            (1)
//
// Nine removed, two kept. The two kept are averages over ~60 members, which
// leak almost nothing about any individual, and CalculationAuditPage's
// formula notes are kept for the same class of reason — that page documents
// the model to whoever is auditing it, and describes the STARTING_FINANCIALS
// range rather than any member.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT COUNTS AS PLAYER-FACING, AND WHY THE ALLOWLIST IS BY EXPRESSION.
//
// Scanned: src/pages and src/components — every render path — plus the export
// builders in src/utils that those pages call. NOT scanned: the engines,
// which must read the attribute to simulate it.
//
// The allowlist matches whole EXPRESSIONS, not files. Allowing a file would
// mean the next `member.riskQuality` added to MembershipPage passes silently,
// which is precisely the regression this exists to catch. Allowing
// `averageRiskQuality` and refusing `member.riskQuality` is the distinction
// that carries the ruling: an average is a pool statistic, a per-member read
// is the attribute.
//
// ⚠ COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED BEFORE MATCHING, because a comment cannot render.
// This file's own subject matter means the surfaces it guards are full of
// comments EXPLAINING the absence of risk quality, and a gate that counted
// its own justification as a violation would be unusable. Commented-out
// markup is not a leak either — it starts leaking on the commit that
// uncomments it, and that commit is the one this catches.

// THE EXPERIENCE-RATIO PATH — a second surface, and it needed asserting rather
// than assuming.
//
// MembershipPage now renders a LOSS RATIO column per member, and Renewal
// Underwriting thresholds on it. The ratio is actual primary loss over the
// member's own expected primary loss, so it is derived from THEIR OWN CLAIMS —
// an observable a pool administrator genuinely has — and not from the hidden
// attribute. That is the claim. This asserts it.
//
// ⚠ THE PROPERTY THAT MAKES IT TRUE IS ONE LINE OF ARITHMETIC AND IT IS EASY TO
// LOSE. `expectedAtManual` is the expectation with RISK QUALITY ALONE OVERRIDDEN
// TO NEUTRAL (memberLossHistory.ts states it). primaryShare does the same on the
// other leg. So neither leg of the ratio carries the member's own score, and
// what survives is how their realized claims compared with a neutral member of
// their class. Drop the override — write `member.riskQuality` where
// `riskQualityOverride: NEUTRAL_RQ` stands, or pass the member's own value —
// and the denominator starts absorbing the attribute. The ratio would still
// LOOK like a claims statistic while having become a partial readout of the
// score, and the column would be showing the player exactly what the ruling
// hides.
//
// It would also be invisible to the scan above, because memberExperienceMod.ts
// is a util and not a surface. So the assertion is here: in the ratio's own
// module, EVERY mention of risk quality must be a neutral override.
// ===========================================================================
{
  // ⚠ TWO MODULES, BECAUSE THE RATIO FEEDS TWO THINGS. memberExperienceMod
  // computes it and bills on it; renewalUnderwriting RANKS members on it for the
  // renewal slider. A member is chosen ON that number rather than merely billed
  // by it, so it must be computed at neutral risk quality on both legs.
  // renewalUnderwriting gets its ratio by delegating to memberExperienceMods, so
  // today it inherits the property; it is listed so that the day someone
  // computes a ratio locally instead, the gate is already watching the file.
  //
  // ⚠ newBusinessAppetite.ts WAS THE SECOND MODULE AND IS DELETED. Intake no
  // longer reads the loss ratio at all: intakeInspection.ts reads TRUE risk
  // quality through a deliberately noisy inspection, engine-side, as the claim
  // engines do. That is not a surface, and the page sums its probabilities
