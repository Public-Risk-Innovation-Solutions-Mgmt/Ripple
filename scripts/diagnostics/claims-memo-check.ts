// THE CLAIMS LISTING IS A REGISTER, AND EVERY ROW IN IT IS REAL — A GATE.

// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/claims-memo-check.ts
//
// The exhibit is a large-loss listing now: evaluation date, program, member,
// status, paid, incurred. Its failure modes are all QUIET ONES — a row that
// renders correctly and is wrong, or a column that is uniform and therefore
// carries nothing:
//
//   a dash where a member name belongs            (the member did not resolve)
//   a Paid figure that is not the workbook's      (a second allocation)
//   a Status that is not the workbook's           (a second closure draw)
//   a CLOSED file in an inventory of open ones     (the filter did not fire)
//   a year's Paid not summing to the cohort's paydown  (dollars invented or lost)
//   a year's Incurred not summing to the cohort's ultimate  (a stale vintage)
//   a Paid above the Incurred beside it            (the two columns disagree)
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE CENTRAL ASSERTION IS AGREEMENT WITH THE CLAIMS WORKBOOK, because that
// is the property the design was chosen for.
//
// Paid is an ALLOCATION — no payment is recorded against an individual claim
// anywhere in this simulation. The listing could have computed its own split
// over the developing set; it reads the register and calls the same
// `claimPaidSplit` and `isClaimClosed` the workbook calls, precisely so one
// claim cannot carry two different numbers in two documents. A gate that only
// checked the listing internally would not notice that guarantee breaking, so
// this one recomputes the workbook's answer independently and compares.
//
// ⚠ AND IT RUNS BOTH ARMS — live and reloaded. The register is stripped from
// the save and redrawn by claimRegeneration, so the listing's whole source is
// reconstructed after a reload. Measured at 41 ms for a full year-10 book; what
// matters here is that it is the SAME book, claim for claim.
