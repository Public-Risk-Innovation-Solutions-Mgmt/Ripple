// THE REINSURANCE TOWER IS PRICED AT RUNTIME — this is what guards it.
//
// Run: npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/tower-runtime-check.ts
//
// Replaces the frozen constants' guard rails. Those were checkable by reading a
// number out of a file; a computation needs a different kind of check, and the
// three that matter are:
//
//   1. THE MEMO KEY. This is the dangerous one. towerMoments caches band moments
//      keyed by (line, layer, severity-year, group, region). A wrong key silently
//      prices one year's tower with ANOTHER year's moments — and every downstream
//      figure stays perfectly self-consistent, so neither export gate would show
//      a thing. Cold-cache and warm-cache interleaved evaluation must agree
//      exactly, and distinct years must give distinct answers.
//   2. THE ANALYTIC MUST MATCH THE GENERATOR. The closed form is exact for a
//      lognormal mixture, but "exact" is a claim about the algebra, not about
//      whether the algebra describes the draw. Monte Carlo cross-check, with CIs.
//      (This is where the retired wc-tower-rederive.ts's simulation machinery
//      went — it used to produce constants; now it validates a computation.)
//   3. THE SHARED-FACTOR FLOOR. A line whose members all share one annual factor
//      has an SD/E that cannot go below sqrt(Vg) no matter how large the book
//      gets, because that factor multiplies every member simultaneously and does
//      not diversify. GL floors at sqrt(1/25) = 0.2000 and WC at
//      sqrt(1/8.01) = 0.3534; Property has no such term and decays toward zero.
//      Same code, different limit — asserted in both directions.
//
// Plus: the above-tower band's gate (newly possible — see section 5), the
// runtime cost budget, and the enrolment feedback loop the runtime price
// introduces.

  //
  // The held pure premium moved only +0.30% on the same change, so the layers
  // moved MORE, and progressively more with attachment depth. That is excess-
  // layer elasticity, not an error: E[ceded to a layer] responds to a severity
  // scale with elasticity above 1, and further above it the deeper the
  // attachment sits in the tail. A mean shift of +0.30% therefore lands as
  // +0.41% at $1M and +0.51% at $10M. If these ever move by the SAME percentage
  // as the pure premium, that is the thing to be suspicious of.

  // GL's are untouched — region never entered GL's severity.

  // WC_LOSS_MODEL.wcYearFactor is a MEAN-ONE multiplier on arrival rates, so

  // win — wcFrequencyTrend was being evaluated once per member with the same

  // at the COMPONENT level rather than the rating-group level (four distinct WC
  // severity components serve eleven group-component pairs).

  // shorter than twenty years.
