// THE PIN IS A PROPOSAL, THE BAND IS THE TARGET — A GATE.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/pin-vs-band-check.ts
//
// STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM looks like a capital standard and is not one. The
// pre-game is a reject-and-redraw search: runLinePreGame simulates a candidate
// three-year past, tests its ending surplus against
// OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND, and redraws until one lands inside. The pin
// sets where that search STARTS; the band sets where it LANDS.
//
// EVERY READER GETS THIS WRONG, INCLUDING THE TWO WHO WROTE THE SURROUNDING
// CODE. It was read as the opening capital target while planning a change to
// pin surplus to the reserve, and the change would have moved nothing it was
// meant to move. The constant's own retired comment made the same mistake from
// the other end: it went looking for a per-line CAPITAL rationale to explain
// 0.70 / 0.45 / 0.18, found none, and recorded the absence as a defect. There
// was nothing to find. The ordering was carrying the offset between each line's
// natural opening and its band, not a statement about capital.
//
// So the misreading is the thing being guarded, and this is the falsifier:
// perturb the pin hard and show that the OPENING BARELY MOVES while the REDRAW
// COST moves by a multiple. A claim about a constant's role that nothing can
// falsify is a story; this makes it a measurement.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, per line, under a x{PERTURB} perturbation of the shipped pin:
//
//   OPENING INSENSITIVE   the median accepted opening surplus/premium moves by
//                         no more than MAX_OPENING_SHIFT against a pin that
//                         DOUBLED. This is a real claim rather than a tautology:
//                         the accepted opening is confined to the band, but
//                         every band here is ~48% wide, so a pin that genuinely
//                         set the opening would slide the median from one end of
//                         it to the other. Two normalisations are printed beside
//                         the raw figure — the shift as a share of the band's own
//                         width, and the elasticity against the +100% pin move —
//                         because the raw percentage on its own invites exactly
//                         the threshold-fiddling this file warns about.
//
//   REDRAWS SENSITIVE     the redraw cost responds at least MIN_ELASTICITY_RATIO
//                         times as elastically to the pin as the opening does.
//                         The raw attempts multiple is printed but NOT asserted
//                         — see the block at MIN_ELASTICITY_RATIO for why a bare
//                         multiple is basis-dependent and this is not. The
//                         shipped pins are calibrated to MINIMISE this, so any
//                         perturbation can only raise it and the test is
//                         one-sided by construction.
//
//   NO FALLBACK           neither arm may hit MAX_HISTORY_ATTEMPTS. If the
//                         perturbed arm falls out of the band entirely, the
//                         closest-miss fallback returns an opening that is NOT
//                         in the band, the first assertion becomes meaningless,
//                         and this check would pass or fail for the wrong
//                         reason. Asserted rather than assumed.
//
// ⚠ THE PERTURBATION IS MULTIPLICATIVE AND READ FROM THE SHIPPED VALUES, never
// typed in. Hard-coding "0.70 -> 1.40" would rot the moment the pins are
// re-centred, which is exactly what the commit that added this check did.

// ⚠ THE OLD RAW FLOOR IS GONE, NOT KEPT AS AN UNUSED CONSTANT. It read 3.0.
// Leaving it declared-and-unread would be a threshold nobody enforces sitting
// where a reader would take it for the live one.
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE REDRAW ASSERTION IS NOW AN ELASTICITY RATIO, AND THE RAW x3 IS REPORTED
// RATHER THAN ASSERTED. THE ASYMMETRY WAS THE DEFECT.
//
// The OPENING side of this check is normalised twice — as a share of the band's
// own width and as an elasticity against the pin move — with the header's own
// reason: "the raw percentage on its own invites exactly the threshold-fiddling
// this file warns about." The REDRAW side had no such normalisation. It was a
// bare multiple, and a bare multiple is basis-dependent: it reads how far a
// line's candidate distribution has to travel before its own band stops
// catching it, which is a property of that distribution's spread, not of
// whether the pin is a proposal.
//
// The reserve re-anchor exposed it. GL, correctly centred at -0.0 SE by
// opening-centring-check, reads 2.56x (3.55 -> 9.07 attempts) against the 3.0
// floor. Both explanations the failure message offers are false: the pin IS
// centred, and 3.55 mean attempts is not a band that "accepts almost anything".
// What actually happened is that GL's candidate distribution has a long enough
// lower tail that displacing it above the band still leaves draws falling back
// into it. That is GL's spread, and the old 3.0 was calibrated when GL's band
// was on PREMIUM against a differently-shaped distribution.
//
// So the assertion is restated on the same footing as the opening's: the redraw
// cost must respond MUCH more elastically to the pin than the opening does.
//
//   attempts elasticity = ln(attempts ratio) / ln(PERTURB)
//   opening  elasticity = shift / (PERTURB - 1)          [unchanged, as printed]
//   assert     attempts elasticity >= MIN_ELASTICITY_RATIO x opening elasticity
//
// MEASURED BY THIS GATE at the shipped pins and bands: WC 46x, GL 25x,
// Property 41x. The floor is 10x — below the weakest line by 2.5x, and not a
// number chosen to clear it by a hair.
//
// ⚠ AND IT STILL FAILS SOMETHING, WHICH IS THE POINT, AND THE FIGURES BELOW ARE
// MEASURED RATHER THAN REASONED. An earlier draft of this block asserted a
// collapse to 0.20 and a 135x drop; those were derived from the mechanism and
// were wrong when run — the real collapse is real but a tenth that size. Widen
// each line's band 4x about its midpoint, which is the exact condition the
// failure message names ("wide enough to accept almost anything"), and the pin
// genuinely does start setting the opening:
//
//   line       opening elasticity   attempts ratio   ELASTICITY RATIO
//   WC           0.095 -> 0.509      4.64x -> 2.50x    23.3x ->  2.6x
//   GL           0.064 -> 0.438      2.44x -> 1.49x    20.1x ->  1.3x
//   Property     0.022 -> 0.363      5.01x -> 2.07x   104.6x ->  2.9x
//
// All three fall far below the 10x floor, so the restated assertion detects the
// condition the raw multiple did not. (Those readings are from a scratch
// harness with its own seed sequence, so its shipped-band column does not equal
// this gate's 46/25/41; the comparison that matters is shipped-against-widened
// within one harness, and the collapse is 9x / 15x / 36x.)

// measuring the fallback. That is a statement about whether the x2 probe is
// still safe, not about whether the pin is still a proposal.
//
// They were one exit code and IBNER_CALENDAR_RHO forced them apart. The

// share falls and a DOUBLED pin now exhausts the cap on about 3% of seeds —
// measured at SEEDS=120: 0 of 120 at the shipped pin against 4 of 120
// perturbed. Every elasticity assertion still passes in that same run (WC 42x,
// GL 12x, Property 41x against the 10x floor; at the 40-seed default the same
// three read 36x / 16x / 60x). With one code, excusing that would also excuse an elasticity

// ⚠ AND THE ANSWER IS NOT TO LOWER PERTURB. This file's own note already
// records that x2.5 put WC into fallback on 4 of 10 seeds BEFORE the blend
// existed; the blend has moved that boundary down to x2, which is information,
// not a nuisance. Tuning the perturbation until the headline numbers come true
// is named in this same file as the failure this directory keeps finding. The
// fix is a probe that measures elasticity without a fallback-prone arm, and
// until it exists this exits 3 and EXPECTED_RED names it.
