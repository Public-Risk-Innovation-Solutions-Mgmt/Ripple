// CLF LABEL BACKTEST — does the funding slider's PERCENTAGE mean what it says,
// on the mechanism that actually ships?
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE BASIS CHANGED HERE, AND IT IS THE SECOND TIME. Read this before
// quoting any figure that predates it.
//
// This gate has now been wrong twice about WHAT to divide by, and both times the
// wrongness produced a headline number that people then reasoned from:
//
//   v1  loss / pooled mean loss     reported GL's worst error as -3.2pp and
//                                   called the labels sound. Valid only while
//                                   the book holds its size, which it stopped
//                                   doing when the membership target came out.
//   v2  netIncurredLoss / premium   reported -21.9pp on GL. Correct denominator,
//                                   WRONG NUMERATOR — see below.
//   v3  accidentYearUltimate / premium   this file. ~0 on GL.
//
// The -21.9pp of v2 was not a defect in GL_SUPPLIED, was not evidence about the
// loss model, and was not a book-size error. It was an artefact of comparing a
// curve about accident years against a statistic about calendar years.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THE CALENDAR-YEAR FIGURE IS LOWER. THIS IS THE WHOLE 22pp AND IT WILL BE
// ASKED AGAIN, SO IT IS WRITTEN OUT.
//
// netIncurredLoss in calendar year t is not one accident year's cost. It is:
//
//     this year's accident year, booked at a marked-down initial estimate
//   + development on EVERY open prior accident year, each at a different age
//
// On GL that is up to eight prior years at once, against a cohort whose estimate
// develops 2.6x from inception to settlement. Summing eight partly-independent
// development draws and one booking is an AVERAGE, and averaging cuts spread.
// Measured on the same accident years, same books, same tables:
//
//     GL accident-year ratio    mean 1.0288   CV 0.3878
//     GL calendar-year ratio    mean 0.9633   CV 0.1818
//
// The calendar basis has LESS THAN HALF the volatility. GL_SUPPLIED's own
// implied CV, read off its quartiles, is 0.3979 — within 2.5% of the
// accident-year figure and more than double the calendar-year one.
//
// ⚠ AND A PERCENTILE MOVES FAR MORE THAN THE CV GAP SUGGESTS, which is why the
// error looked catastrophic rather than merely wrong. Halving the spread pulls
// every stop toward the mean, so a multiplier set for the wide distribution
// covers almost everything in the narrow one at the top and almost nothing at
// the bottom. That is exactly the shape v2 reported: +20pp at the 70% stop and
// -22pp at the 30%, on a curve that is within 2pp of right.
//
// ⚠ SO THE 22pp WAS NEVER EVIDENCE ABOUT THE LOSS MODEL. Two readers in
// succession took it as a reason to change the model — once by replacing the
// real-pool curve with a derived one, once by raising GL's claim frequency. Both
// were rejected on measurement. clfTables.ts's own note still names the
// frequency route as "the real fix"; it is not, and the reason is here.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT IT MEASURES, AND WHY THIS BASIS.
//
// A CLF stop is a promise about a FUNDING DECISION. A player funding at the 75%
// stop is buying confidence that THIS year's claims will come in under THIS
// year's premium. That is an accident-year question and it is answered only once
// the year has run off.
//
//     realised confidence at stop p
//       = share of ACCIDENT YEARS whose settled net ultimate came in at or under
//         staticClf(line, p) x that same year's poolPremium
//
// Calendar-year incurred answers a different and narrower question — "will
// underwriting income be positive this year" — and its prior-year development
// belongs to years that were funded separately, by premiums already collected.
// clfTables.ts chose the calendar basis for the derivation because
// underwritingIncome = poolPremium - netIncurredLoss is an exact identity, which
// is true and is about the P&L rather than about the funding decision the slider
// labels. Both arms are printed below; only the accident-year one gates.
//
// ⚠ THE DENOMINATOR IS EACH YEAR'S OWN PREMIUM, NOT A POOLED MEAN, and that part
// of v2 stands. A single constant can stand in for expected loss only while
// exposure holds still, and the book is a trajectory — roughly 76 -> 92 enrolled
// members at defaults. Under a pooled mean an early year looks cheap and a late
// year dear from exposure alone, and the per-band split would report growth as
// label error.
//
// ⚠ NO CIRCULARITY, AND IT IS STRUCTURAL. At all-defaults fundingAtExpected is
// true, so CLF is pinned to exactly 1.000 and poolPremium is the priced expected
// net loss with no table lookup in it. The appetite arms vary newBusinessAppetite
// only and never touch the funding flag, so the pin holds on every observation.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE SOURCE IS THE APPEND-ONLY LEDGER, AND MATURITY IS TESTED PER ROW.
//
// ReserveCohort is filtered out of reserveCohorts the year after it closes, so a
// settled cohort's final estimate is not readable there. LinePoolState.
// reserveDevelopment keeps a ReserveDevelopmentRow per accident year carrying
// ultimateByValuation (NET, oldest first) and survives closure.
//
// ⚠ ITS TYPE COMMENT SAYS "NOTHING IN THE ENGINE CONSUMES THIS" AND THAT IS NO
// LONGER TRUE. simulationEngine builds experienceBasis.rows from
// windowRows(lineState.reserveDevelopment) and PRICES off it — S3 experience
// rating, exactly the event the type comment warned about ("if a priced or
// booked quantity ever starts reading this ledger, the ledger has become engine
// state"). The warning fired and was never updated. Noted at the type as well.
//
// THAT DOES NOT MAKE THIS GATE CIRCULAR, and the reason is worth being precise
// about rather than waving at. Premium for accident year t now does depend on
// the ledger's rows up to t-1, so numerator and denominator are not independent
// — a pool that developed badly prices higher next year. That is a real feedback
// in the model and the player lives inside it. The circularity that WOULD matter
// is the table entering its own test, and it does not: at all-defaults
// fundingAtExpected pins the CLF to exactly 1.000, so no stop of the curve being
// scored is consulted anywhere in forming poolPremium.
//
// Each row carries its OWN drawn `horizon` and development stops once age passes
// it, so a row counts only when its last valuation is at or past that horizon.
// No worst-case bound, no fixed maturity age. Seeded cohorts are excluded: they
// are apportioned from a drawn reserve total rather than summed from claims, so
// their first entry is a game-start estimate and not an inception register.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS WHY THE RUN IS 22 YEARS. WC's horizon is drawn on [5, 12], so a WC
// accident year needs up to twelve further years to settle. At ten years the
// sample would be a handful of short-horizon cohorts — a biased subset, not a
// small one, because short horizons are not a random sample of accident years.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ WC AND PROPERTY KEEP THEIR CALENDAR-BASIS TABLES. RULED, NOT OUTSTANDING.
//
// This is a DECISION and not an unresolved red. Neither line should be re-derived
// on the strength of what this gate prints: that was costed and declined.
//
//   WC        GATED ON CALENDAR-YEAR, where it reads -7.2 / -2.2 / -1.2. On the
//             accident-year basis it would read -7.0 / -11.0 / -7.5, and
//             re-deriving onto that basis raises every off-Expected stop by 3.2%
//             to 6.0% — see the INDICATED CURVE section the run prints.
//
//   Property  GATED ON CALENDAR-YEAR, where it reads +7.5 (thin, ungated) / +3.6
//             / +1.2. Close enough on BOTH bases that re-deriving buys almost
//             nothing; its accident-year indicated curve moves only -2.6% to
//             +4.0%.
//
//   GL        GATED ON ACCIDENT-YEAR, and is the case that carried the basis
//             change: -0.5 to +1.7pp from the 70% stop up, against -21.7pp on
//             the calendar basis. Its accident-year ratio CV is 0.4168 against
//             the supplied curve's implied 0.3979.
//
// ⚠ AND WC CARRIES AN OBJECTION THE OTHER TWO DO NOT, which is what decided it.
// A default game is ten years and WC's runoff horizon is drawn on [5, 12], so a
// WC accident year written in a game can outlive it. Measured: only 16.4% of WC
// accident years written in a ten-year game reach their own horizon before it
// ends, against GL 45.3% and Property 71.0%. A WC table derived on settled
// ultimate would charge for cost the player never sees land in their own P&L in
// FIVE GAMES OUT OF SIX.
//
// That does not make the basis wrong — funding IS a claim about ultimate cost,
// and ultimate cost is unobservable at the moment of the decision in real
// ratemaking too. It makes WC the line where the accident-year basis buys the
// least and costs the most, and the ruling followed the measurement.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THE RULING ACCEPTS, NAMED SO IT IS NOT DISCOVERED LATER. The slider
// carries the same words on all three lines while GL's curve now describes
// accident years and WC's and Property's describe calendar years. So "75%
// confidence" does not mean exactly the same thing per line. That is a real
// user-facing inconsistency, it was chosen with the numbers above in view, and
// closing it means re-deriving two tables and accepting a 3-6% WC premium rise
// for cost most players never see.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ RESOLVED: EACH LINE IS GATED ON THE BASIS ITS OWN TABLE WAS BUILT ON.
//
// This was an open question for one commit and is now settled. Before, every
// line was scored on accident-year ultimate, so WC and Property carried reds
// that were DEFINITIONAL — their curves are calendar-year percentiles and were
// never built to meet an accident-year bar. A red that is always there is a red
// nobody reads, and this project has found that failure family twenty-two times.
//
// The alternative considered and rejected was to report WC and Property and
// assert only GL. It would have left both lines asserted by NOTHING, because the
// calendar panel was printed and not gated: a regression in WC's table, or in
// the loss model beneath it, would have produced no red anywhere in this file.
// The positive control would still have fired, but proving the instrument works
// is not the same as asserting the curve is right.
//
// ⚠ IT DID NOT COME BACK GREEN AND THAT IS CORRECT. Two residuals survive, both
// real, neither silenced by the re-pointing:
//
//   WC   -7.2pp on the SMALL band, on its own calendar basis
//   GL  -11.6pp at the 30% stop on the large band, on its own accident-year basis
//
// Nothing was narrowed, loosened or dropped to make those read better. The point
// of the re-pointing is that every red is now ACTIONABLE — it names a real gap
// between a curve and the distribution that curve claims to describe — not that
// the gate goes quiet.
//
// ⚠ WHAT WC's SMALL-BAND RESIDUAL IS, characterised but NOT fixed here. It is a
// BOOK-SIZE LEVEL EFFECT, and the band-mean column added to each row is what
// shows it. WC's calendar-basis mean ratio by band:
//
//     small ~64   1.042      worst error  -7.2
//     mid  ~80    1.035      worst error  -2.2
//     large ~97   1.025      worst error  -1.2
//
// The mean falls monotonically as the book grows, and the error tracks it. A
// small book runs a 1.7% higher loss ratio than a large one, so its whole
// distribution sits higher, so fewer of its years fall under the LOW stops —
// which is exactly the signature: about zero at the 95% stop, growing negative
// toward the bottom of the range.
//
// That is a LEVEL difference between books, not a mis-shaped curve, and a single
// curve with no book-size axis cannot carry it by construction. clfTables.ts
// records that decision and its measured cost; this is the same cost seen from
// the gate's side. NAMING IT IS NOT FIXING IT and it is not fixed here.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ REPORTED WITH A CI, GATED ON THE WORST STOP IN THE WORST BAND, AND CARRYING
// A POSITIVE CONTROL. A gate that reads near zero needs proof it can move at
// all, more than one reading 22pp did. Every run re-scores a deliberately
// mis-scaled copy of each shipped table and asserts it FAILS. If the control
// goes quiet the gate is blind and the run fails on that alone.
