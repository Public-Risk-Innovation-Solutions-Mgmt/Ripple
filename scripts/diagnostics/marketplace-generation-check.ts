// MARKETPLACE-WIDE GENERATION CHECK — stage 2 of the experience-modifier work.
//
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/marketplace-generation-check.ts
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT CHANGED AND WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
//
// Claims are now generated for ALL 200 canonical members every year, not just
// the enrolled book, so that a prospect arrives with a readable loss record and
// adverse selection becomes something the player can read. Only ENROLLED claims
// feed pool losses, premium, reserves and reinsurance.
//
// That split has two failure modes, and BOTH CORRUPT QUIETLY RATHER THAN FAIL
// LOUDLY, which is exactly why they are asserted here:
//
//   TRAP 1 — the mix correction computed on the wrong book. k_line / k_GL must
//     come from the ENROLLED book; it is the enrolment-mix correction that lets
//     purePremiumPer100 be held. Handing it the 200-member roster drives it to
//     ~1 and disables the correction. On the canonical roster the two values
//     differ by only ~0.4% (0.9820 enrolled vs 0.9781 roster), so nothing
//     downstream would look wrong. This is why kLineApplied is exposed on the
//     result at all: so the rule can be ASSERTED, not reviewed.
//
//   TRAP 2 — prospects generated with pool benefits. k_line and risk control are
//     properties of POOL MEMBERSHIP. Applying either to a prospect gives
//     non-members free safety consulting AND makes their history depend on the
//     enrolled book's RQ mix — the incoherence the per-member stream keying
//     removed. Prospects must draw at k = 1, rc = 0.
//
// PLUS the containment check that matters most: prospect losses run ~10x
// enrolled losses at a 68/200 book, so any leak into a pool figure is a
// 10x error, not a rounding one.
//
// VERIFICATION IS STATISTICAL, NOT VALUE-FOR-VALUE. The per-member stream keying
// in stage 1 moved every draw, so old baselines cannot be compared number by
// number. What must still hold is the pricing invariant: enrolled gross loss
// over its own analytic expectation sits at 1.00. Measured at 1.0021 over 1,000
// line-years before this work.

// DO NOT "RESTORE" A GROUND-UP GATE HERE. It was tried and it fails on correct
// code.
//
// GL's fitted mixture has a blended CV of 29.55 — component 1 alone carries
// 99.1% of the loss at CV 21.5. At that tail weight a 200-line-year sample mean
// is nowhere near normal: the mean is carried by draws rarer than the sample
// usually contains, so the realized figure sits BELOW expectation until a large
// draw lands, and the CI — computed from realized variance — is itself unstable,
// which is finding 26's whole point. Measured on the ground-up basis: 0.8725
// with a +/-0.1063 band, excluding 1.00 on entirely correct code.
//
// CAPPING AT $1M BOUNDS PER-CLAIM VARIANCE, so a normal CI is valid however
// heavy the raw tail is — the same reasoning that makes a finite reinsurance
// layer's ceded mean gateable where an unlimited layer's is not. The capped
// gate is ~1.8x tighter and is a real test: it is what caught the k_GL defect
// (see below), which the ground-up figure had buried in its own noise.
//
// WC STAYS ON THE GROUND-UP FIGURE, and that is not an inconsistency. WC has a
// REPORT LAG: its drawn loss in year y includes prior-accident-year claims
// emerging late, drawn at prior years' k_line and trend factors. A tight capped
// gate there would be measuring that emergence transient rather than the pricing
// invariant, so the honest instrument for WC is the wide one. WC's CV (~11-14)
// is also low enough that the ground-up CI covers correctly, which is why this
// gate has always passed for WC.
//
// HISTORY: before the GL rebuild both lines were gated on ground-up and both
// passed. GL's rebuild made its tail heavier and the GL gate started failing; it
// was briefly converted to reported-only, which was the wrong call — diagnosing
// a failure is right, deciding it does not count is not. It is now gated on the
// quantity that can carry a gate.
