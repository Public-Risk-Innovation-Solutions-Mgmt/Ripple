//
// ⚠ THIS GATE IS GREEN AND IT WAS COMMISSIONED AS A RED. It was asked for as
// "experience-pricing-check's loop-stability arm, which was never built, and
// which will fail the moment it exists". BOTH HALVES OF THAT WERE WRONG, and the
// file exists anyway for the reason at the bottom of this header. What follows
// is what was actually found, because a gate built on a retracted premise has to
// carry the retraction or the next reader re-derives it.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE ARM EXISTS. IT IS ARM 3 OF experience-pricing-check AND IT PASSES.
//
// "DOES THE LOOP STAY STABLE?" — a perturbation experiment: twin games on one
// instance, one twin shocked out of Expected funding for a single year, loop
// gain read as A x B off the divergence. It asserts A < 1 and A x B < 1, reads
// 0.26 / 0.28 / 0.45 on the shipped path, and reads 12.96 on GL against the
// pre-fix double-cession engine, so its silence is a reading and not an absence.
// The gate exits 0, all three arms green, and its EXPECTED_RED entry was already
// removed. simulationEngine's comment saying the arm was owed and the flag was
// off was stale prose on both counts and is corrected at this commit; so was
// gates.ts's tier note.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ AND THE DRIFT IT WAS COMMISSIONED TO CATCH IS NOT THERE. ONE SEED IS NOT A
// MEASUREMENT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE LESSON OF THIS FILE.
//
// The commission cited "Property's charged rate falls 18.1% over ten years on a
// frozen roster, 0.0917 -> 0.0873 -> 0.0751". That figure is real, reproducible,
// and ONE GAME. Across games, on the same construction:
//
//     GAMES = 8      +0.60%  +/- 2.98%
//     GAMES = 40     -0.22%  +/- 1.71%
//
// Property's charged rate does not drift. The single-seed -18.1% sits about two
// standard deviations out on a per-game spread of ~11%, which is an unlucky draw
// and not a defect. It was reported as a finding before it was averaged, and
// this file is partly the apology for that.
//
// ⚠ THE MECHANISM PROPOSED FOR IT IS ALSO WRONG, AND THAT WAS MEASURED RATHER
// THAN DROPPED. The story was that PRICING_TRIANGLE prices off the pool's own
// BOOKED triangle, FORWARD_BOOKING contracts every occurrence before the
// triangle sees it, and so each year another under-booked cohort enters the
// window and ramps the rate down. Steepening Property's contraction should then
// steepen the ramp. It does not — 12 games at each k:
//
//     k = 0.924533 (shipped)   drift +0.20%   rate 0.09932 -> 0.10000
//     k = 0.890000             drift +2.00%   rate 0.07552 -> 0.07447
//     k = 0.850000             drift +2.02%   rate 0.05427 -> 0.05543
//     k = 0.800000             drift -0.67%   rate 0.04201 -> 0.04100
//
// The contraction moves the LEVEL hard — better than halving the charged rate
// between the first row and the last — and moves the TREND not at all. On
// reflection that is what a ROLLING window of fixed length must do: once it has
// filled, every year holds the same mix of contracted cohorts, so there is a
// level shift and no accumulating ramp. There was never a ramp to find.
//
// (The level shift is its own matter and is NOT this gate's subject. A charged
// rate that halves when a booking constant moves is what
// experience-pricing-check arm 1 grades, and it grades it green at 1.024 /
// 1.038 / 0.994.)
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ WHY IT IS COMMITTED ANYWAY, AND THIS IS THE ONLY ARGUMENT FOR IT.
//
// Not because it found something. Because it PINS something that nothing else
// pins, and the two gates divide the subject cleanly:
//
//   arm 3 measures the LOOP — how a displacement propagates. Twin-differencing
//   is what makes it robust, and twin-differencing CANCELS anything common to
//   both twins, so an exogenous ramp in the pricing basis is invisible to it by
//   construction. Its own header declines the ambient measurement on purpose:
//   "watching an already-stable system settle proves nothing".
//
//   this file measures the AMBIENT LEVEL PATH — whether the rate sits still when
//   the book sits still. Loop gain below 1 and monotone drift are not
//   alternatives; a stable loop driven by a ramp is stable and drifting.
//
// So the claim "the charged rate is flat on a still book" is now measured rather
// than assumed, and a future change that introduces a ramp is caught by this
// file rather than by somebody noticing it in a single game — which is exactly
// how it was almost "found" this time, in the wrong direction.
//
// It also closes a hole the other gate names in its own closing line:
// "PRICING_TRIANGLE alone is a configuration nothing here has measured."
// Cell 3 below is that configuration.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ PROPERTY IS THE INSTRUMENT AND IT IS THE ONLY LINE ASSERTED ON BY DEFAULT.
//
// The three lines are not equally readable, and the two that are confounded are
// confounded by their own held paths rather than by anything this gate is about.
// Measured here, ten years, PRICING_TRIANGLE OFF, zero sampling error because
// the held path is deterministic:
//
//     WC        -9.80%   the wage divisor outruns the 6% / 3.5% trends
//     GL       +14.87%   glCappedSeverityTrend, capped near 2.0%/yr, not 7%
//     Property   0.00%   PROPERTY_HELD_PURE_PREMIUM_PER_100, to the digit
//
// On WC and GL a flag-on reading has to be scored against a moving null, and
// differencing two engine configurations is the basis hazard this repo has
// retracted more findings to than anything else. Their exposure also moves 37.8%
// over ten years, so their books are not still and the statistic does not mean
// on them what it means on Property. On Property the null is a constant, the
// roster is frozen to 0.000%, and a flat reading is the EXACT expectation rather
// than a tolerance band.
//
// WC and GL are RUN AND PRINTED with their flag-off nulls beside them so the
// confound is visible and quantified rather than argued about. They are not
// graded. Asserting them needs a modelled expectation, not a second engine.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE POSITIVE CONTROL, BECAUSE A GATE THAT HAS NEVER FIRED IS NOT A GATE.
//
// The in-file control (cell 2, PT off) reads 0.00% with zero standard error and
// proves the statistic is not manufacturing drift. That is only half of it. The
// other half is that it FIRES on real drift, and the shipped engine supplies
// some: GL's charged rate genuinely climbs.
//
//     LINE=GL MAX_EXPOSURE_MOVE=1 npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/experience-pricing-drift-check.ts
//
// reports GL at +10.97% against a firing threshold of 6.40% and EXITS 2. Both
// knobs are needed and each says something: LINE moves the assertion, and
// MAX_EXPOSURE_MOVE lifts the stillness precondition that otherwise — correctly
// — refuses to grade a line whose book moved 37.8%. Neither is a default and
// neither is a way to make the gate lenient; they only ever make it assert on
// MORE than it does by default.
//
// ⚠ AND THE FLATNESS CONTROL IS SKIPPED ON ANY LINE BUT PROPERTY, WHICH THE
// FIRST BUILD OF THIS FILE GOT WRONG. It fired on GL's held path — correctly
// finding +14.87% — and took the positive control's exit from 2 to 1, so the
// demonstration that exit 2 means the drift assertion was itself broken. The
// held path is only a constant on Property; on WC and GL a nonzero reading there
// is the held path working.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE BAR, AND WHAT IS AND IS NOT DERIVED IN IT.
//
// On a still book with a constant true expected loss the correct drift is ZERO.
// There is no principled positive value, so the assertion is a SIGNIFICANCE test
// — |mean drift| > 3 standard errors across games — and the one positive number
// is labelled as the concession it is:
//
//   DETECTION_FLOOR exists ONLY so this does not become a thermometer for GAMES.
//   A pure 3-SE test tightens without limit as the sample grows and would
//   eventually fire on any nonzero drift however small. 2% over ten years is a
//   JUDGEMENT about what is worth a red. It is not derived and is not dressed up
//   as derived.
//
// The gate reports the threshold it actually achieved at the sample it ran, so a
// reader can see what it could and could not have caught. At the shipped GAMES
// it catches a drift of about 6.5% and up; the WC and GL drifts above are inside
// that range, which is the sensitivity check that matters.
