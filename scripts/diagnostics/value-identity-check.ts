// THE DIVISION OF LABOUR — read before "improving" either gate.
//
// There are TWO export guards and they answer DIFFERENT questions. Neither
// subsumes the other, and collapsing them is the mistake this comment exists
// to prevent.
//
//   THIS SCRIPT (value identity)      solo-export-guard.ts (shape identity)
//   -----------------------------     ------------------------------------
//   "did any VALUE move?"             "did the export SHAPE change?"
//   keyed by FIELD NAME               SHA-256 of the exported CSV
//   order-independent                 order-sensitive
//   label-independent                 label-sensitive
//   new fields are reported,          any new row, renamed label or
//     NOT a failure                     reordering turns it red
//
// A DISPLAY-LAYER FIX should be GREEN here and RED on the hash guard: it
// corrects what is shown without touching what is computed.
// AN ENGINE REGRESSION should be RED here — that is the signal that matters.
//
// This distinction is not theoretical. The expected-combined-ratio fix
// corrected two exported metric values, added one metric and renamed six
// labels. The hash guard went red on all 12 exports, which by its construction
// it HAD to, and that told us nothing about whether the engine had moved.
// This check answered it in one run: 14,400 numeric fields bit-identical, with
// movement confined to the two metrics the fix targeted plus the one it added.
//
// So: THIS is the primary gate for display-layer work. The hash guard is the
// shape check — still valuable, because an unintended column reorder or a
// dropped row is invisible here. Do NOT "fix" a red hash guard by re-hashing
// without first confirming this check is green, and do NOT delete the hash
// guard because this one is stricter about values. They are complementary.
// ============================================================================
//
// Coverage matches the hash guard exactly — same 3 seeds x 4 line
// configurations x 5 years — so the two are directly comparable. Every finite
// numeric field on every line result AND on the pool result is captured, which
// is roughly 14,850 values.

// v6: retired v5 at the per-member RNG stream change plus the deriveSubRng
// finalizer that change proved necessary (finding 26).
//
// Measured for the PER-MEMBER KEYING ALONE, which is the diagnostically useful
// decomposition: 6,404 of 14,850 fields moved across WC-solo/GL-solo/tri, and
// PR-solo moved 0 of 2,970 — Property is not on the claim-generator path, so
// that was the no-leak assertion, and it held. Field count stayed at 14,850
// with 0 added and 0 removed. Within the three moved scopes the ONLY field
// names that did not move are the same 28 structurally invariant ones in each:
// the HELD purePremium/purePremiumPer100 and the rate/CLF figures derived from
// it, decision inputs at defaults, and fields that are constant or identically
// zero (commonLossFactor and catastropheFactor are the legacy aggregate-path
// fields WC and GL no longer read). That is what a TOTAL move looks like — 43%
// of all fields reads as partial until it is partitioned by scope.
//
// The finalizer then moved everything again, Property included, because it
// changes seed derivation for every label. v6 reflected both.
//
// v7: MARKETPLACE-WIDE GENERATION, and it is an ADDITIVE SHAPE CHANGE ONLY —
// 0 of 14,850 values moved. Claims are now generated for all 200 canonical
// members, but per-member stream keying means a prospect's draws come from that
// prospect's own stream and cannot touch an enrolled member's, so every pool
// figure is bit-identical to v6. The only difference is 60 new kLineApplied
// fields. That zero-movement result IS the containment proof for stage 2, on
// top of a 40-seed attribution run showing the enrolled drawn/expected ratio
// unchanged to four decimals.
//
// v8: CLF-ONLY PRICING (decision-surface work). The Rate Change decision was
// deleted and the funding-confidence-level default moved from 0.75 to 0.60 —
// ISOLATED AND CONFIRMED SEPARATELY: with the default temporarily held at its
// old 0.75 value, this check read 0/14,910 changed, so the mechanical
// deletion of the three now-dead rateChange terms (all already zero at
// rateChange=0 defaults) moved nothing on its own. Every one of the 11,051
// changed values at the real 0.60 default was downstream of that one
// deliberate default change, not a side effect of the field removal.
//
// v9: TWO CORRECTIONS TO THE v8 WORK, EACH ISOLATED THE SAME WAY.
//   (1) updateSatisfaction's (fundingConfidenceLevel - 0.75) term went from
//       inert (zero at the old 0.75 default) to live AND BACKWARDS at the new
//       0.60 default — charging members less was making them unhappier.
//       Neutralised to coefficient 0 rather than sign-corrected: the 0.75
//       anchor is now arbitrary, and the whole term is slated for replacement
//       by bill-based satisfaction (Stage 2.5). Isolated with fix (2) held
//       back (CLF still 1.003): 2,302 changed across 71 fields, led by
//       memberSatisfaction itself (150 instances, e.g. 7 -> 7.4 — moving UP,
//       i.e. the wrong-signed drag being removed) and its retention/surplus
//       cascade.
//   (2) FUNDING_CLF_TABLE[0.60] moved from 1.003 to the reference chart's
//       1.000 — the chart is the authority. Isolated with fix (1) held back
//       (satisfaction coefficient still 0.5): 7,256 changed across 76 fields,
//       led by selectedFundingCLF itself (150 instances, 1.003 -> 1) and the
//       entire pricing/premium/reserve cascade at the 60% default.
// Combined (both fixes, the real shipped state): 8,135 changed across 77
// fields — NOT the sum of the two isolated runs (2,302 + 7,256 = 9,558),
// because the two channels interact nonlinearly (satisfaction feeds
// retention feeds exposure feeds premium, which the CLF fix also moves).
//
// v11: EIGHT ENGINE COMMITS, RECAPTURED TOGETHER RATHER THAN AFTER EACH ONE.
// aa0838a (per-occurrence reinsurance tower for WC AND GL) through a08b88e
// (wage inflation on WC's exposure base) — see the recapture commit for the
// full list. This baseline was allowed to go stale across all eight so that
// intermediate work could be isolated against its own parent commit instead
// (worktree + temporary capture script, five times); this is the first
// recapture since v10.
//
// 14,910 -> 16,110 fields (1,200 added, 0 removed): eight new fields
// (aggregateAttachment, aggregatePremium, aggregateRecovery,
// emergedPriorYearLoss, ibnrAccrual, ibnrReserve, retainedAboveTower,
// unreportedClaimCount) from the tower rebuild and the IBNR provision, each
// present on every scope regardless of active line (Property carries them at
// a fixed default — it is still on the legacy aggregate path).
//
// 7,863 of the 14,910 pre-existing fields changed, across 81 field names —
// entirely pricing/loss/reserve/membership cascade fields, nothing
// structural. By config: WC-solo 2,318/3,225 moved, GL-solo 2,045/3,225
// moved, tri 3,500/6,450 moved, PR-solo 0/3,210 moved.
//
// GL-solo moving is NOT a leak: aa0838a explicitly rebuilt GL's reinsurance
// from the old aggregate quota-share model to the same per-occurrence tower
// shape as WC, so GL's attachment/poolLosses/excessLosses/quotaShareLosses/
// netUltimateLoss/reinsuranceCost all changed model, and the resulting rate
// change cascades into memberSatisfaction, averageRiskQuality, activeExposure
// and marketShare through the ordinary retention/pricing feedback loop. The
// other seven commits (3181b18, 19d04e7, b4805bc, d66e8fb, cd154e2, 332cae4,
// a08b88e) touch WC only.
//
// PR-solo staying at 0/3,210 changed (0 added beyond the 240 shared new
// fields) IS the leak check this recapture needed: Property's engine was not
// touched by any of the eight commits, and this baseline proves it.
//
// v12: SIX MORE COMMITS, RECAPTURED TOGETHER: 23da65c, 72ecaa0, 4f695a0,
// 326e275, c1cec1b (GL's own rebuild — fitted-mixture severity, k_GL
// neutralised, severity trend, the $100M cap, GL's own CLF grid) and a21d01b
// (an "Expected" funding option, defaulting BOTH WC and GL to CLF = 1.000 in
// place of a fixed percentile stop). Plus 8c0ae6f, a UI-only squash-merge
// (the Welcome-to-Ripple setup modal) — CONFIRMED GATE-INERT: this script's
// full stdout, diffed byte-for-byte against a21d01b before the merge and
// after, came back empty.
//
// 16,110 -> 16,140 fields (30 added, 0 removed BY THIS TOOL'S COUNT — but
// that undercounts what actually changed shape: 23da65c replaced GL's
// claimCountsBySub (an object) with a scalar claimCount, and this script only
// ever tracks `typeof v === 'number'` fields, so the object-valued field's
// removal is invisible to it. The 30 additions are all one field name,
// claimCount, at 15 instances each in GL-solo and tri (3 seeds x 5 years).
//
// 6,393 of the 16,110 pre-existing fields changed, across 79 field names. By
// config: WC-solo 1,315/3,225 moved (0 new fields), GL-solo 2,155/3,225 moved
// (15 new), tri 2,923/6,450 moved (15 new), PR-solo 0/3,210 moved (0 new).
//
// WC-SOLO'S MOVEMENT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXACTLY ONE MECHANISM — cross-checked
// against solo-export-guard.ts's v12 note, which bisected it directly: WC-solo
// held byte-identical through c1cec1b (the first five of the six commits are
// GL-only) and only started moving at a21d01b, whose sole WC-facing change is
// the fundingAtExpected ternary in simulationEngine.ts's selectedFundingCLF
// dispatch. GL-solo's 2,155/3,225 reflects the CUMULATIVE effect of all five
// GL-only commits plus a21d01b's GL-side default change — not isolated
// per-commit here, since none of the five were recaptured on their own (the
// same "recapture together, not after each" choice v11 made).
//
// PR-solo staying at 0/3,210 changed (0 new fields) IS the leak check this
// recapture needed: none of the six commits, nor the UI squash, touch
// Property.
//
// v13: ONE COMMIT, f5ece4d — moved WC and GL from frozen per-layer
// reinsurance constants to runtime computation of E[ceded] and SD[ceded] from
// the enrolled book and the current year, plus a fix to the WC aggregate's
// occurrence-frequency basis (nominal exposure -> real payroll x
// wcFrequencyTrend). A PRICING-BASIS change: no claim generator, severity,
// frequency or roster parameter moved, so every field that changed did so
// through the reinsuranceCost -> totalMemberCharge -> premium/reserve/
// membership cascade, not through a different loss draw.
//
// 16,140 -> 16,140 fields, 0 added, 0 removed. The six retired constants
// (expectedCededPer100, sdOverExpected, AGG_OCC_FREQ_PER_1M,
// AGG_OVERDISPERSION, WC_RETAINED_SECOND_MOMENT and its bitmask index) were
// all INTERNAL to reinsuranceTower.ts / towerMoments.ts — none was itself an
// exported LineResultSet/ResultSet field, so retiring them could not change
// export shape, only the values downstream of them. Confirmed rather than
// assumed: this scan's own added/removed counts are both zero.
//
// 3,820 of the 16,140 fields changed, across 71 field names. By config:
// WC-solo 953/3,225 moved, GL-solo 1,146/3,240 moved, tri 1,721/6,465 moved,
// PR-solo 0/3,210 moved. Led by reinsuranceCost itself (105 instances, e.g.
// $5,681,786 -> $8,025,186 on one WC line-year) and its cascade into
// totalMemberCharge, ratePer100, the loss/expense/combined ratios, and from
// there into retention, exposure and market share the ordinary way.
//
// PR-solo staying at 0/3,210 (0 new fields) IS the leak check this recapture
// needed: Property runs the legacy REINSURANCE_PROGRAMS path, untouched by
// f5ece4d, and this proves it was not reached.
//
// v14: EIGHT COMMITS — see solo-export-guard.ts's matching v13->v14 note for
// the full per-commit attribution; this note covers only what differs at the
// field-value level.
//
// 16,140 -> 15,540 fields, 0 added, 600 removed: ibnrReserve, ibnrAccrual,
// emergedPriorYearLoss, unreportedClaimCount, all from 962ef60 (WC's report
// lag and IBNR removed). 150 instances each (matching any other fully-
// populated field), NOT a WC-only 30 or 60 — these were LineResultSet fields
// present at 0 on every line ("WC only; 0 on GL and Property, which have no
// report lag", per the old type comment), so they populated every line's own
// scope AND the pool scope, on every config. None of the four was ever in
// RESULT_METRICS (checked against 962ef60^'s resultMetrics.ts — zero
// matches), which is why solo-export-guard's hash of the actual exported
// workbook never saw them and could not have caught this removal on its own;
// this scan's added/removed count is what does.
//
// 10,590 of the 16,140 baseline fields changed, across 78 field names. By
// config (numerator excludes the 4 removed fields; denominator is the v13
// baseline count for that config): WC-solo 2,113/3,225, GL-solo 2,133/3,240,
// PR-solo 2,068/3,210, tri 4,276/6,465.
//
// PR-solo MOVING IS NOT A LEAK — the opposite of the v13 pattern, and
// expected: fdc747c and bdc98ec are membership/pricing machinery shared by
// all three lines (each commit's own message says so, and the mechanism null
// test is the isolation used in place of a line control), and a3d7760's
// opening band applies per line to all three. The other five commits in this
// range (875cb75, fab85e4, f328d65, 3d3fbcc, 962ef60) are confirmed WC/GL-only
// by solo-export-guard's per-commit PR-solo hash check; this scan cannot
// separate their contribution from fdc747c/bdc98ec/a3d7760's inside one
// cumulative diff, which is why the hash guard's per-commit run is the
// isolation tool here, not this one.
//
// v19: retired v18 at the feature/ibner merge. Friedland IBNER replaces reserve
// development on ALL THREE LINES, so 9,120 of 15,300 fields moved and there is
// NO LINE CONTROL in this range for the first time — every previous recapture
// had a line that could not move and served as the leak test. The isolation was
// the MECHANISM NULL TEST instead: make both mechanisms inert and ask whether
// the trees agree. They do, once two non-mechanism channels are removed, and
// the ladder is in the lineage doc.
//
// ⚠ TWO THINGS A READER WILL GET WRONG FROM THE NUMBERS ABOVE THE LINE.
//
// FIRST, "0 added, 0 removed" DOES NOT MEAN THE DATA MODEL HELD. ReserveCohort
// gained five fields and lost `developmentFactor` in this range, and
// ReserveDevelopmentState was deleted outright. Cohorts live on poolState; this
// script walks ResultSet and LineResultSet, and the hash guard is scoped to
// RESULT_METRICS. Neither gate can see a cohort. The shape columns answer a
// narrower question than they look like they answer — fifth occurrence.
//
// SECOND, TWO COMMITS IN THE RANGE READ 0 OF 15,300 AND ARE STILL CORRECT.
// 4fbbb5a raised the booking-bias coefficient 1.6x and a84d854 rewrote the
// unwind schedule; both are invisible here because premiumFundingRatio is a
// hardcoded 1, so bookingBias is 0 on every cohort this gate ever constructs.
// ibner-null-check sections 3 and 4 squeeze funding to each line's reachable
// minimum stop and prove them there. Do not read a green gate as evidence a
// mechanism is inert when the gate cannot reach it.
// v20: retired v19 at the pool-scope aggregation audit.
//
// ⚠ THIS ONE MOVED THIS GATE WHILE BEING DISPLAY-ONLY, AND THAT IS NOT A
// CONTRADICTION — it is what this script captures. It records the POOLED row
// alongside each line, and the pooled row is precisely what was corrected. The
// decomposition is the whole proof:
//
//   37 changed, ALL in `tri`, ALL at `pool` scope, across four field names
//     (activeMembers 15, memberRetentionRate 15, withdrawnMembers 4, newMembers 3)
//   0 at ANY line scope        -> no aggregation feeds the engine
//   0 in WC-solo/GL-solo/PR-solo -> with one active line every aggregation is the
//                                   identity, so a solo pool cannot move unless
//                                   the aggregation itself is broken
//   150 added: enrolmentCount
//
// So "did a VALUE move" needs the scope partition to answer here. A red line
// scope would have meant the engine moved; a red solo config would have meant
// the aggregation broke. Both were green.
// v21: retired v20 across SEVEN commits, and it is the most boring range in this
// file's history — ZERO values moved at any of them. Every commit was diagnostic
// or display: the Calculation Audit page audited row by row, three new checks
// built over it, and every disagreement they found repaired.
//
// The whole range produced ONE shape change, at ebdb147: 300 removed
// (fundingAdequacyRatio and premiumFundingRatio, 150 instances each). FIVE fields
// were deleted there — the other three are STRINGS and this gate captures numbers
// only, so a five-field deletion reads as two here. That asymmetry is a property
// of the instrument, not of the change.
//
// ⚠ AND CLEARING THE PHANTOM IS PART OF THE POINT. That shape change sat in the
// v20 baseline for seven commits, so every run printed a standing "removed 300"
// line while still declaring HOLDS. A permanent informational line is not free:
// it is exactly what trains a reader to skim, and skimming is how the Market
// Share defect survived a release with a guard on it — its failure was sitting in
// a list of legitimately-moving fields. This capture reads 0 added, 0 removed.
//
// ⚠ MEASURED PER COMMIT EVEN THOUGH SIX ROWS WERE PREDICTED TO BE NOTHING, which
// is the case for doing it: a range where every row is expected to be zero is the
// one nobody verifies. All seven were run against the fixed v20 reference (valid
// because nothing in baselines/ and neither guard script changed in range), and
// solo-export-guard was run at every intermediate commit too — 84 hashes, all
// matching.
// v22: THE FIRST RANGE SINCE v11 IN WHICH THE ENGINE ITSELF MOVED, and it moved
// on every line at once. Reserve development now lands on CLAIMS and cedes
// through the occurrence tower, so 6,577 of 14,400 values changed across 74
// fields and all 12 export hashes differ. There is NO LINE CONTROL — the
// mechanism reaches WC, GL and Property identically — so the null test is the
// MECHANISM SWITCH: DEVELOPMENT_CESSION_ENABLED = false reproduces v21
// bit-for-bit, 0 values changed, 12/12 hashes matching.
//
// ⚠ TWO SHAPE ADDITIONS, BOTH MEMO FIELDS: priorYearDevelopmentCeded (what the
// tower absorbed of prior-year development) and bookingGiveBack (the recovery
// forfeited by booking the claim register low). NEITHER MAY BE ADDED TO INCOME —
// netUltimateLoss is already net of the first and priorYearDevelopment of the
// second, exactly as reinsuranceRecovery has always worked.
//
// ⚠ AND ONE SHAPE CHANGE THIS GATE CANNOT SEE. 1e05a55 added the
// reserveDevelopment ledger, which lives on LinePoolState rather than ResultSet,
// so it is invisible here — the sixth time this instrument's scope has mattered.
// It is a recording, not a value: 0 changed at that commit.
// v23: NO VALUE MOVED. The capture DOUBLED, from 14,400 fields to 28,800, because
// this gate gained a SQUEEZED ARM — see THE ARMS below. Every v22 key reappears
// under a `def|` prefix with a bit-identical value; everything new is `sqz|`.
//
// ⚠ THE ARM AND ITS BASELINE HAD TO LAND TOGETHER, and the laundering risk that
// normally argues against that is controlled a different way here. A recapture
// blesses whatever is in the tree, so the discipline is to separate the
// instrument change from the capture — but an arm with no baseline is a gate
// that cannot run, so there was nothing to separate them into. Instead the
// defaults half was diffed against v22 key-for-key BEFORE this file was written:
// 14,400 keys, 14,400 matched, 0 changed. The new content is a new arm on an
// unchanged tree, and that is checkable rather than asserted.
// v24: NOTHING MOVED HERE AT ALL. The recapture exists only so this file and
// SOLO_EXPORT_GUARD stay on the same version number — the export gained three
// columns and renamed two labels, which moved all 24 hashes and 0 of these
// 28,800 values. Captured and diffed key-for-key against v23: 28,800 keys,
// 28,800 matched, 0 changed.
// v25: SHAPE ONLY. shockLossAmount removed — 300 keys (150 instances x 2 arms),
// 0 values changed. It was `shockOccurred && !isClaimLine`, structurally false
// since Property got its claim generator, and this gate had it on the bit-exact
// list under BOTH arms — which is the report shape that says "structurally dead"
// rather than "inactive in this configuration". bookingGiveBack, zero in `def`
// and live in `sqz`, is the contrast the per-arm split exists to draw.
// v30: THE DEVELOPING SUBSET NOW FOLLOWS CLOSURE — 11,748 of 29,400 changed
// across 72 fields, 0 added, 0 removed.
//
// ⚠ AND THIS ONE HAS A REAL CONTROL, WHICH NO CAPTURE SINCE sizeWeighted HAS
// HAD. The standing caveat is that a selection change spends RNG and reseeds the
// `ibner` stream, so a line-by-line diff cannot separate mechanism from reseed.
// It does not apply here: the reselection draws were routed onto their own
// streams keyed on (seed, valuation year, line, accident year, purpose), and
// `ibner` still takes exactly ten developing-set picks at inception in the same order.
//
// So the control is CLOSURE FORCED OFF rather than the mechanism switch. With
// `isClosed` stubbed to `() => false`, reselection is a no-op that spends no
// draw, and the mechanism-ON tree is BIT-IDENTICAL to v29: 29,400 fields, 0
// added, 0 removed, 0 differing. Every one of the 11,748 moved values is
// therefore closure driving reselection and nothing else. The mechanism-off
// before-and-after was run too and is also 0 differing.
// v31: the developing set is sized to hold its own movement, the spill stops
// landing on settled claims, and "carrier" is gone. 9,367 of 29,400 changed
// across 37 fields, 0 added, 0 removed.
//
// ⚠ THREE CAUSES IN ONE CAPTURE, AND THEY WERE MEASURED SEPARATELY AS THEY WENT
// IN, because a recapture blesses whatever is in the tree:
//   the RENAME moved values, which is not obvious — the reselection stream is
//     keyed on a purpose string and `carriers` became `developing`, so that
//     stream re-rolls. Sign-symmetry: WC 1.07x -> 1.06x, GL and Property
//     unchanged.
//   the SPILL EXCLUDING CLOSED OCCURRENCES is the behavioural fix. Property
//     0.88x -> 1.07x, WC and GL within 0.01x.
//   the SIZING RULE moved set sizes (11-16 against a floor of 10 on 1.06% of
//     developing cohort-valuations) and moved no ratio and no cession level:
//     WC 51.0%/51.0%, GL 60.2%/60.2%, Property 14.2%/14.2% before and after.
//
// The mechanism-off before-and-after reads 29,400 fields, 0 differing, so
// nothing outside the mechanism moved. v30's closure-forced-off control is NOT
// available here and would not be meaningful: the sizing rule does not depend on
// closure, so stubbing the predicate no longer reduces the commit to a no-op.
// v32: the developing set is DRAWN FRESH at every valuation instead of
// persisting between them — 8,413 of 29,400 changed across 37 fields, 0 added,
// 0 removed.
//
// ⚠ THE CLOSURE-FORCED-OFF CONTROL FROM v30 NO LONGER ISOLATES, and saying so is
// the point of this note. It worked because reselection was a no-op when nothing
// closed; a set that redraws every valuation redraws whether or not anything
// closed, so stubbing the closure predicate leaves the mechanism running. What
// survives is the mechanism switch: DEVELOPMENT_CESSION_ENABLED = false,
// parent vs child, reads 29,400 fields and 0 differing.
// v33: GL's occurrence id became per-member. The id feeds isClaimClosed, closure
// feeds reselectDevelopingSet, and 38 fields moved down the development ->
// cession -> reserve -> surplus chain. No GL claim AMOUNT moved; established
// three ways, recorded in the lineage.
// v34: STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM re-centred — 17,785 of 29,400 changed across
// 77 fields, 0 added, 0 removed. THIS ONE IS A WHOLE-TREE RE-ROLL AND THE FIELD
// LIST SHOULD BE READ AS ONE. The pre-game is a reject-and-redraw search on
// (seed + attempt x 997); moving the pin moves which attempt is accepted, so a
// different past is simulated, a different roster enrols, and every draw-side
// quantity re-rolls with it — activeMembers 59 -> 58, claimCount 43 -> 24.
// There is no subset of this diff to attribute, and a field-by-field reading of
// it would be reading noise.
//
// ⚠ SO THE ATTRIBUTION IS THE SEPARATION, NOT THE DIFF. dbcfed7 was measured
// alone first: it adds rcEffectivenessApplied (180 fields, the +180 in this
// capture's SHAPE line) and moves 0 of 29,400 values. Every one of the 17,785 is
// therefore the pin. What the pin change is FOR is asserted by
// opening-centring-check, which measures the unfiltered candidate median against
// the band midpoint directly and can fail; this capture only records that the
// tree moved, which for a re-roll is the one thing it can honestly say.
// v35: THE LOSS-RATIO BASIS FIX, AND THIS CAPTURE IS THE EVIDENCE IT STAYED IN
// THE DISPLAY LAYER. 600 fields ADDED (actualLossRatioPricingBasis and
// actualLossRatioRetainedPremium, 2 x 150 instances x 2 configurations), 0
// removed, and 0 of the 29,580 pre-existing values changed. That last number is
// the point of recapturing here rather than arguing: the change adds two
// derived quotients of dollar figures that already existed, so if any loss,
// premium, reserve or surplus figure had moved, it would have reached the
// engine and that would have been the finding instead. It did not.
//
// ⚠ CONTRAST v33 AND v34 DELIBERATELY. Both were whole-tree re-rolls where no
// field-by-field reading was possible. This one is the opposite shape — a pure
// addition — and a capture that shows 0 changed values is a STRONGER statement
// than one that shows a plausible-looking subset moved.
// v36: THE PER-CLAIM FLIP. PER_CLAIM_REVISION.enabled false -> true. A WHOLE-TREE
// RE-ROLL and there is no field-by-field reading to be had: 15,840 of 30,180
// values moved across 79 fields, 0 added, 0 removed.
//
// ⚠ THE RE-ROLL IS NOT THE MECHANISM AND THE DISTINCTION IS MEASURABLE. The flag
// alone does not shift the RNG stream — `factor` is drawn in both arms whether or
// not the enabled arm uses it, which was deliberate at 42b2c2b. What re-rolls
// every game is that the PRE-GAME ACCEPTANCE SEARCH takes a different number of
// attempts on the two arms (measured at the flip: WC mean 2.93 -> 2.70, GL 3.06
// -> 3.05, Property 3.97 -> 4.12), and each rejected candidate past consumes
// draws. So the tree moves for two reasons at once and this capture cannot
// separate them.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED INSTEAD, because a re-roll capture cannot carry it: the shape
// of the flip was measured paired, same seeds both arms, 300 games x 10 years —
// ending pool surplus 0.9886x, insolvency 5.3% on BOTH arms, net unpaid reserve
// within 1% on every line, actual loss ratio within 0.5pp on every line and
// basis. The mechanism's own correctness is held by cohort-ledger-check (three
// identities, both arms), martingale-equivalence-check (term by term) and
// terminal-severity-check (phi on its anchor), all green at this commit.
// v48: WC'S OPENING SURPLUS BAND RE-TRANSLATED ONTO ITS CURRENT J (0.3294 ->
// 0.4730) AND ITS PIN RE-SOLVED WITH IT (0.3254 -> 0.4718). 2,084 of 31,200
// fields moved across 19 fields, 0 added, 0 removed.
//
// ⚠ THE CONFINEMENT IS THE POINT AND IT IS READABLE OFF THE FIELD LIST ALONE.
// Every one of the 19 is on the capital/investment chain: endingSurplus,
// availableSurplus, availableFunding, beginingSurplus, surplusFromIncome, the
// four funding-gap aliases (fundingGap, capitalFundingGap,
// excessAvailableSurplus and its ratio), excessCapitalRatio,
// capitalAdequacyRatio, beginning/endingInvestments, investedAssets,
// totalAssets, investmentIncome, netIncome. NO loss, premium, reserve, rate or
// membership field moved. That is what a starting-capital change must look
// like: the pin adds surplus, surplus is the invested base, investment income
// follows — and nothing reaches the underwriting side.
//
// THREE OF THE 19 MOVE IN THEIR LAST BITS ONLY and are not a value change:
// surplusTieOutDifference (-3.7e-9 -> -1.9e-9), beginningCash (...422 -> ...424)
// and investmentReturnRate (...695 -> ...6947). Those are re-association at a
// different magnitude, not arithmetic that decided anything.
//
// A REPRESENTATIVE ROW, and the defect being fixed: excessCapitalRatio
// -0.2100 -> +0.1166 — Deficient to Adequate. WC opened at 0.570..0.827 of its
// own required margin on 100 of 100 seeds and now opens 0.813..1.188.
//
// ⚠ THE LEAK CHECK IS SOLO_EXPORT_GUARD v48'S, NOT THIS FILE'S, and it is the
// stronger statement: all 6 GL-solo and all 6 PR-solo exports are BYTE-IDENTICAL
// while all 6 WC-solo and all 6 tri moved. This baseline is pool-level and
// cannot separate the lines that way, so read the two notes together — the same
// pairing v46 and v47 record.
//
// v47: GL'S TRIANGLE CONTRACTION RE-SOLVED, A 2.156982 -> 2.295852 (+6.44%), to
// close a 6% mean-preservation failure — a claim developed to its terminal was
// averaging 0.9395 of the value drawn. 8,260 of 31,200 fields moved across 78
// fields, 0 added, 0 removed.
//
// ⚠ IT IS A REPRICING, NOT A RESERVE CORRECTION, AND THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY
// PERTURBATION BEFORE SOLVING ANYTHING. GL's rate reads the pool's own played
// paid triangle (currentPurePremiumPer100's ExperienceBasis — the S3 path), so
// the contraction feeds the rate. poolPremium and purePremiumPer100 are in the
// moved list for that reason, not as a side effect of reserves. Measured:
// GL booked reserve +9.14%, GL premium +8.39%, ending surplus +0.22%.
//
// ⚠ AND THE MOVE IS CONFINED TO GL. solo-export-guard moved GL-solo 6 of 6 and
// tri 6 of 6, with WC-SOLO AND PR-SOLO BYTE-IDENTICAL — the mirror image of
// v46, where WC moved and GL did not. Two commits in a row where the export
// split is what proves the scope claim rather than an argument for it.
//
// v46: WC'S AGGREGATE LOSS VOLATILITY RAISED TO 0.30 ON THE CALENDAR BASIS, via
// a shared year factor (WC_LOSS_MODEL.wcYearFactor, Gamma shape 6.28, mean
// exactly 1) multiplying every WC member's arrival rate. 8,796 of 31,200 fields
// moved across 77 fields, 0 added, 0 removed.
//
// ⚠ THE MEAN DID NOT MOVE AND THAT IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED. wc-cutover-check
// perturbs the factor's shape by 4x and requires expectedWcGrossLossForPricing
// to come back BIT-IDENTICAL, which it does at 48608807.629813. So no held pure
// premium, held class rate or k_line re-derives, and every field that moved here
// moved through VARIANCE rather than through level.
//
// WHAT MOVED, and it is three distinct channels rather than one:
//   1. the losses themselves, year to year, which is the point;
//   2. the reinsurance risk load — WC's layer SD/E gained a floor at
//      sqrt(1/6.28) = 0.399, HIGHER than GL's 0.200, so towerMoments prices WC's
//      tower differently. This is the only place the change touches a price;
//   3. SATISFACTION.surplusComfortable 0.0258 -> 0.1385 and surplusWeight
//      0.0344 -> 0.0516, re-solved because excessCapitalRatio's denominator
//      moved again. Second consecutive commit in which those two re-solve.
//
// ⚠ AND THE OPENING PIN DID NOT MOVE, WHICH IS THE INTERESTING ONE.
// opening-centring-check went red on WC at 1.7 SE and the pin is correct:
// measured at 2,400 seeds the shipped 0.3254 sits 0.18 SE off its band
// midpoint. The gate's sample was too small for its own tolerance and has been
// raised 400 -> 1,600; STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM is untouched. See that file.
//
// v45: WC TOOK A SUPPLIED CLF CURVE, AND THE SURPLUS LIMB WAS RE-SOLVED BEHIND
// IT. WC now prices off a real public-entity pool's measured percentile curve
// over 45-95, extended down to 10 on a fitted lognormal; WC_DERIVED is retained
// out of force as GL_DERIVED is.
//
// ⚠ THIS CAPTURE IS LARGER THAN v44'S AND THE REASON IS NOT THE FUNDING SLIDER.
// v44 moved only 3,948 of 31,200 fields because at all-defaults
// fundingAtExpected pins selectedFundingCLF to 1.000 and the table is never
// consulted. That still holds — ending surplus at Expected is BIT-IDENTICAL
// across this swap, checksum 3316958079.914983 over 40 games. What moves the
// extra fields is the OTHER reader: reserveMarginCLF is staticClf(line, 0.90),
// WC's 90% stop went 1.3120 -> 1.4730, and reserveRiskMarginNeeded =
// expectedNetUnpaidLoss x (reserveMarginCLF - 1) rose about 52% on WC. That is a
// default-game quantity, so it moves whether or not anyone touches the slider.
//
// ⚠ AND IT REACHED SATISFACTION. excessCapitalRatio has reserveRiskMarginNeeded
// as its denominator, so WC's median fell 0.1831 -> -0.2196 and the pooled
// median 0.2399 -> 0.0258. SATISFACTION.surplusComfortable and surplusWeight
// were re-solved to 0.0258 and 0.0344 in the same commit, because leaving them
// put member-satisfaction-check red on its own 25% cancellation bound at 31.6%.
// Those fields move here too. A CLF table reached a satisfaction constant
// through the reserve margin, in one commit, with no edit to either file.
//
// v44: WC'S CLF TABLE RE-DERIVED AT THE SMALL BAND. The shipped default writes
// no new business on a frozen pre-game roster, so a player who touches nothing
// plays a book frozen at ~62 — and WC's table was derived at 72-88. It is now
// derived on 6,371 line-years of the small band across 2,000 games and FIVE
// appetite arms, the fifth being the shipped default.
//
// 0 added, 0 removed, and only 3,948 of 31,200 moved across 63 fields — THE
// SMALLEST CAPTURE IN THIS FILE'S RECENT HISTORY, against 21,481 at v43 and
// 22,559 at v42.
//
// ⚠ AND THE SMALLNESS IS THE STRUCTURAL PROPERTY CONFIRMING ITSELF, NOT A WEAK
// CHANGE. At all-defaults fundingAtExpected is TRUE, which pins selectedFundingCLF
// to exactly 1.000, so the table is NEVER CONSULTED in a default game. The moved
// fields are the ones that read it — fundingGap and capitalFundingGap lead the
// list. A table re-derivation that moved the default game's own losses or
// membership would mean the table had reached somewhere it must not.
//
// ⚠ ENDING SURPLUS OFF EXPECTED IS THE SAME NUMBER BEFORE AND AFTER. Measured,
// 150 games x 10 years, full pool: Expected $83.435M on both arms, bit-identical.
// At the 75% stop it goes $177.280M -> $182.198M, +$4.918M (+2.8%) — a GAIN in
// funding rather than a cost, because the small-band curve is heavier (the 75%
// stop moves 1.1373 -> 1.1716).
//
// THE COST OF THE RULING IS IN THE LABEL, NOT THE SURPLUS, and it is recorded at
// WC_DERIVED: small -8.7 -> -3.1pp, mid +4.3 -> +9.3pp, large +13.0 -> +18.4pp.
// WC goes from one band outside tolerance to two.
//
// v43: NO NEW BUSINESS AS THE DEFAULT APPETITE. One capture for a sequence of
// four commits, and it MIXES EXACTLY ONE ENGINE CHANGE WITH THREE THAT MOVE
// NOTHING — which is why the capture is taken once at the end rather than after
// each.
//

//   9c5e18d  the CLF re-derivation measured and declined

//
// 0 added, 0 removed, 21,481 of 31,200 moved across 80 fields. activeMembers
// 71 -> 65 and newMembers 6 -> 0 in the first instance: intake stopped.
//
// ⚠ AND THE OPENING BOOK DID NOT MOVE, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THE CAPTURE RATHER
// THAN AN ASIDE. The pre-game runs at these same defaults, so before the roster
// was frozen structurally at v42 this would have changed the opening and
// therefore the pin. Measured against the parent on the same seeds: WC 63.9,
// GL 62.4, Property 64.4, member ids identical, and opening-centring-check
// unchanged at -0.6 / -0.7 / +0.1 SE. Every moved field below is a PLAYED year.
//
// ⚠ A CORRECTION TO v42'S OWN RECORD. That note states the opening book as
// 60.3 / 56.8 / 67.8. Those were measured BEFORE the pin was re-solved inside
// that same commit and were never re-taken; the shipped figures have always been
// 63.9 / 62.4 / 64.4. The error was reporting a mid-commit measurement as if it
// described the commit. Corrected here rather than edited there, so the mistake
// stays visible.
//
// THE LEAK CHECK: 0 added, 0 removed, every absolute identity bit-exact, no
// suspected partial identity.
//
// v42: THE PRE-GAME ROSTER IS FROZEN, AND THE PIN WAS RE-SOLVED ON ALL THREE
// LINES BEHIND IT. The pre-game no longer moves membership: no joins, no
// departures, no declines, so the year-1 book IS the starting enrolment
// generateStartingPoolState drew — verified member for member, 8 games x 3
// lines, every id identical.
//
// 0 added, 0 removed, 22,559 of 31,200 moved across 80 fields. activeMembers
// 131 -> 71 in the first instance: v41's ten pre-game years of intake with no
// outflow are gone.
//
// ⚠ THIS CAPTURE CARRIES TWO CHANGES AND THEY ARE NOT SEPARABLE, WHICH IS
// STATED RATHER THAN GLOSSED. Freezing the roster moves the opening book, which
// moves the reserve and the premium the opening surplus is measured against,
// which puts STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM out of centre on all three lines —
// opening-centring-check read -6.1 / -6.3 / +4.0 SE. The pin HAD to be
// re-solved in the same commit or the gate could not pass, so no arm isolates
// the freeze from the re-solve. The freeze is the cause and the re-solve is its
// consequence; a reader wanting them apart would have to re-run with the old
// pins, and the numbers to do that are in the constant's own record.
//
// ⚠ AND THIS COMMIT TURNS THREE OF v41's FIVE UNEXPECTED REDS GREEN, WHICH IS
// THE REASON THE TWO SIT TOGETHER. v41's sweep read 58/68: save-size-check
// (a doubled book doubles the save), market-conditions-check,
// marketplace-generation-check, opening-centring-check and pin-vs-band-check.
// The first three are fixed by the freeze alone; the last two needed the pin.
//
// THE LEAK CHECK: 0 added, 0 removed, every absolute identity bit-exact, no
// suspected partial identity — on a change that moved 72% of the fields.
//
// v41: VOLUNTARY DEPARTURES SWITCHED OFF. VOLUNTARY_DEPARTURES_ENABLED = false,
// so the only way out of the pool is a renewal decline. The count that was
// suspended was book x (1 - retentionProb), and retentionProb is BASE_RETENTION
// = 0.95 — a constant from the root commit that has never been derived in this
// repository. See the constant's own record for why an undeclared number could
// not be left setting the book's trajectory once No New Business is a default.
//
// 0 fields added, 0 removed, 23,243 of 31,200 moved across 82 fields. That is
// the largest capture in this file's history — half again the pin re-solve's
// 14,744 — and the reason is that it moves the OPENING BOOK, not just the
// played years.
//
// ⚠ THE PRE-GAME IS WHY IT IS THIS BIG. priorHistoryEngine plays PRE_GAME_DEPTH
// = 10 years through the same processYear, so ten years of intake now run with
// no outflow before the player sees year 1. activeMembers 62 -> 131 in the first
// instance is that: the game does not start where it used to start.
//
// ⚠ AND THE CONFINEMENT IS CHECKABLE THE SAME WAY v40's WAS.
// VOLUNTARY_DEPARTURES_ENABLED is read in exactly ONE place in src/:
//
//   membershipEngine.ts   the slice count in simulateMemberMovement
//
// Nothing else reads it. Every moved value is downstream of a different
// enrolled book, and there is no second channel.
//
// ⚠ THE DRAWS ARE RETAINED, WHICH IS WHY "DIFFERENT BOOK" IS THE WHOLE STORY
// AND NOT HALF OF IT. Both draw sites still run — the count multiplier
// rng.range(0.4, 1.6) and departureRisks' one draw per member — so the
// membership stream is not re-phased and no value moved because a draw landed
// somewhere new. Guarding the draw instead of the slice would have made this
// capture uninterpretable.
//
// THE LEAK CHECK: 0 added and 0 removed, all 38 absolute identities bit-exact
// on every instance (including sqz|declinedMembers = 0 and
// sqz|retainedAboveTower = 0), and no suspected partial identity. A change that
// moved three-quarters of the fields introduced no new one and retired none.
//
// ⚠ ratePer100 5.2289 -> 4.6435, AND THAT FALL IS THE FINDING TO CARRY FORWARD.
// A book roughly twice the size spreads the tower and admin over twice the
// exposure, so the rate drops about 11%. clfTables.ts is derived at the band
// containing each line's median book and says to re-derive if the membership
// trajectory moves materially — it has, and by more than the band is wide.
//
// v40: STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM RE-SOLVED — WC 0.3250 -> 0.2503, GL 0.2062 ->
// 0.1418. Property untouched. opening-centring-check had gone red on WC and GL:
// the unfiltered candidate median sat +0.101 and +0.105 off its band midpoint,
// 9.4 and 6.1 standard errors, against +0.015 / -0.003 / +0.022 when the pin was
// last solved.
//
// 0 fields added, 0 removed, 14,744 of 31,200 moved — far more than the CLF
// re-derivation's 7,566, and on a much wider set of fields.
//
// ⚠ EVERYTHING MOVED, AND THAT IS THE CORRECT OUTCOME RATHER THAN A LEAK. Losses,
// claim counts, exposure, premium, membership and every ratio built on them are
// all in the moved list. The reason is that the pin does not adjust a surplus
// number on an otherwise fixed opening: it changes which pre-game ATTEMPT the
// band accepts, and a different accepted attempt is a different pre-game history
// — a different enrolled roster carried through the maturation years, different
// claims, different reserves. activeMembers 73 -> 62 in the first instance is
// that, not a membership change.
//
// ⚠ THE CONFINEMENT IS STRUCTURAL AND CHECKABLE BY GREP, which is the only
// argument worth making when this much moves. STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM is read
// in exactly TWO places in src/, and both construct the OPENING POSITION:
//
//   instanceGenerator.ts:547   targetSurplus for the seeded opening state
//   priorHistoryEngine.ts:247  targetSurplus inside the pre-game search
//
// simulationEngine.ts never reads it. No played-year path can see the constant;
// the played years see only the pre-game's OUTPUT. So every moved value is
// downstream of a different opening, and there is no second channel for it to
// have reached them by.
//
// investmentReturnRate moves on 25 instances at the sixteenth decimal
// (0.0997962961556695 -> 0.09979629615566948) — summation magnitude, same draw,
// the same signature recorded at v38 and v39.
//
// v39: THE CLF TABLES WERE RE-DERIVED ONTO THE NEW MEMBERSHIP TRAJECTORY.
// WC_DERIVED, GL_DERIVED and PROPERTY_DERIVED are re-measured at the book band
// containing each line's own median book — WC and GL at 72-88, Property at 88+.
// GL_SUPPLIED, which is the curve GL actually prices off, is untouched.
//
// 0 fields added, 0 removed, 7,566 of 31,200 moved.
//
// ⚠ THE MOVEMENT SPLITS EXACTLY ALONG THE TWO ARMS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE
// CONFINEMENT ARGUMENT. Counted from the two baselines directly:
//
//     def   735 values, and SEVEN field names, nothing else
//     sqz 6,831 values
//
// The seven are reserveRiskMarginNeeded, fundingMarginNeeded, fundingGap,
// capitalFundingGap, excessAvailableSurplus, excessCapitalRatio and
// capitalAdequacyRatio — 105 instances each. Every one is the same quantity or a
// ratio built on it: simulationEngine reads staticClf(line, 0.90) on EVERY run to
// size the reserve risk margin, so a re-derived 90th stop moves it whatever the
// player decides. AT DEFAULTS NOT ONE DOLLAR OF PREMIUM, LOSS, SURPLUS, CASH,
// RESERVE OR MEMBERSHIP MOVES, which is the direct evidence that the margin is a
// DISCLOSURE figure and not a charge — endingSurplus is computed independently of
// it (availableSurplus = endingSurplus, not the reverse). The margin moved by
// exactly the factor ratio: 7958396.25 -> 6706893.74 is 0.8428, against WC's
// 0.2776/0.3294 = 0.8427.
//
// The sqz arm is where the PRICING channel lives, because that is the only arm
// with fundingAtExpected off — at defaults the CLF is pinned to 1.000 and the
// table is never consulted for price at all. selectedFundingCLF 0.6698 -> 0.7913
// on WC is the change itself; poolPremium, surplus, reserves and every ratio
// follow from it. activeMembers, withdrawnMembers and memberRetentionRate move
// there too (35 / 21 / 32 instances) and that is EXPECTED rather than a leak:
// membership responds to price, so a different premium is a different book. They
// do NOT move in the def arm, where the premium is identical, which is the
// control that makes the sqz-arm movement readable.
//
// investmentReturnRate moves on 12 instances at the sixteenth decimal
// (0.06703899471230997 -> 0.06703899471230995) — summation magnitude, same draw,
// the same signature recorded at v38.
//
// v38: THE MEMBERSHIP TARGET CAME OUT, AND THE BOOK IS NOW AN OUTCOME.
// MEMBERSHIP_EQUILIBRIUM_ENROLLMENT, its two calibration constants, and both
// movement caps are deleted. Intake is no longer a demand term steered toward a
// level — it is a share of the unenrolled marketplace, filtered by the appetite
// bar, written up to a capacity guard. Departures are proportional and uncapped.
//
// 540 fields ADDED (applicants / eligibleApplicants / intakeRoom, 3 x 180),
// 0 removed, and 75 fields moved.
//
// ⚠ THE MOVEMENT IS CONFINED TO ONE CHANNEL AND IT IS CHECKABLE, WHICH IS WHY
// THIS CAPTURE IS NOT A WHOLE-TREE RE-ROLL LIKE v36. The rng handed to
// simulateMemberMovement is deriveSubRng(seed, year, 'members|<line>') — its own
// stream, one consumer — so adding or removing a draw there cannot re-phase any
// other stream. Every one of the 75 moved fields traces to a DIFFERENT BOOK:
// activeMembers 49 -> 73 in the first instance, and exposure, premium, expense,
// losses and every ratio built on them follow from it.
//
// ⚠ THE ONE FIELD THAT LOOKED LIKE AN INDEPENDENT DRAW WAS CHECKED RATHER THAN
// ASSUMED. investmentReturnRate appears in the moved list, which would mean the
// market draw had shifted. It moved on 32 of 300 instances, by
// 0.09979629615566948 -> 0.0997962961556695 — the sixteenth decimal place. Same
// draw, different summation magnitude. Nothing else in the list is independent
// of the enrolled book.

// v37: THE DEPARTURE REBUILD. Who LEAVES the pool changed basis entirely —
// from `satisfaction + 0.3 x riskQuality` ascending to a price-shock x
// marketability model with fresh annual noise, sorted descending. Different
// members leave, so a different book is enrolled every year from year 1, and
// everything downstream of the roster moves with it: 22,174 values across 79
// fields, 0 added, 0 removed.
//
// ⚠ THERE IS NO NULL ARM THAT REPRODUCES v36, AND THAT IS A PROPERTY OF THE
// CHANGE RATHER THAN A GAP IN THE TESTING. Setting DEPARTURE.priceWeight to 0
// removes the economic term but leaves the fresh annual noise, which is
// itself a stream change against a draw frozen at enrolment. The old key
// cannot be recovered by any constant because the model it belonged to is
// gone. So this capture is justified by CONFINEMENT rather than by a null.
//
// CONFINEMENT, CHECKED: every one of the 79 changed fields is downstream of
// the enrolled roster — exposure, premium, losses, reserves, capital, the
// ratios, and the membership counts themselves. Nothing that should be
// roster-INDEPENDENT moved: no held pure premium, no class rate, no CLF
// table, no reinsurance term. And 0 values are NaN or Infinity, which is the
// check that catches a roster change that quietly divided by an empty book.
//
// ⚠ READ WITH solo-export-guard v37, WHICH MOVED FOR THE SAME REASON. Neither
// capture is sufficient alone here: the hash guard cannot tell "different
// members enrolled" from "the arithmetic broke", and this one says the
// changed set is exactly the set a roster change explains.
// ⚠ v49 -> v50: THE PROPERTY MERGE. Both branches moved this capture, so it
// could not be merged and was recaptured. WHAT IT COST AND WHAT IT BOUGHT:
//   added   1200  poolLayerLoss, poolLayerLossRatio, retainedCoverMargin,
//                 totalLossRatioGross — the flat charge and the ratio pair.
//   removed  300  catastropheFactor, deleted outright by the other branch
//                 because it read 1.0000 on every line in every year.
//   changed 8754  across 79 fields — Property's frequency and severity
//                 recalibration and everything downstream of it.
//
// ⚠ AND CONFINEMENT SURVIVED, WHICH IS WHY THIS RECAPTURE IS NOT A BLANK
// CHEQUE. A merge that moved every line somewhere cannot be checked the usual
// way, so the old capture was diffed against the new one PER CONFIGURATION
// before it was replaced:
//     WC-solo     0 of 5970 values moved — bit-identical
//     GL-solo     0 of 6000 values moved — bit-identical
//     PR-solo  4188 of 6000 moved (69.8%)
//     tri      4566 of 12570 moved (36.3%)
// Property's recalibration is therefore EXACTLY confined to Property. Inside
// the three-line configuration WC moves in 17 fields and GL in 18, and every
// one of them is a CAPITAL quantity — beginningCash, availableSurplus,
// investedAssets, investmentIncome, endingSurplus, totalAssets. Not one loss,
// premium, rate, claim count, cession or reserve field moves on either line.
// The lines share one balance sheet, so a bigger Property book moves the cash
// every line is funded out of; that coupling is the design, and its absence
// from the underwriting fields is the evidence nothing leaked.

// split in two, moving 171 instances under squeezed funding — and this script
// and solo-export-guard BOTH reported 0 changed and 12/12 matching, because
// bookingGiveBack is bit-exactly 0 at default decisions and the split was
// therefore invisible at the only configuration either of them exercised.
//
// "Both gates identical" was a statement about ONE configuration, and this is
// the pair every commit is measured against. THIRD INSTRUMENT WITH THIS
// BLINDNESS: audit-formula-check had it and was given a squeezed arm at 118b1fb
// (which turned one reported defect into eleven), the absolute identity check
// has it and reports it, and this is the one that mattered most.
//
// The squeeze uses EACH LINE'S OWN REACHABLE MINIMUM, not a flat value — WC
// stops at 0.10 (WC_FUNDING_CONFIDENCE_RANGE), GL and Property at 0.30
// (SLIDER_RANGES). Driving all three to 0.10 would test Property at a booking
// bias the UI cannot produce, which overstates the exercise and tests nothing a
// player can reach. Same reasoning, same constants, as audit-formula-check.

  // CLOSED IDENTITY, not a value that happens to be round, and its departure
  // is a defect by construction rather than a change to be explained.
  //
  // The test is deliberately conservative — it fires only when the baseline

  // quantity that is merely usually-zero (dividends, assessments, shock loss)
  // does not trip it. A field that legitimately leaves an identity will still

  // ⚠ "EXACTLY 1" MEANS TO FLOAT PRECISION, NOT BIT-EXACTLY, and that
  // distinction was nearly fatal to this rule. A closed identity evaluated by
  // SUMMING per-line terms picks up ordering noise: at the v15 measurement 6 of
  // 150 expectedCombinedRatio instances sat at 1 +/- 2e-16 rather than exactly
  // 1. A bit-exact test would therefore have refused to arm on the very field
  // this rule was written for, silently, from the first recapture onward.
  //
  // THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN 1 AND 0 IS DELIBERATE. A value that should be 1 is a
  // RATIO — dimensionless — so 1e-12 is a meaningful scale-free bound. A value
  // that should be 0 has UNITS, so no scale-free epsilon exists for it; exact
  // is the only defensible test there and it errs toward firing, which is the
  // right direction for a guard.
  //
  // ⚠ BUT THE SAME BOUND MUST APPLY ON BOTH SIDES, and it did not. The rule
  // used 1e-12 to decide the baseline "was 1" and then STRICT INEQUALITY to
  // decide an instance had moved, so 1 -> 0.9999999999999999 counted as a break
  // of the identity. It fired that way during the TIV rescale, on pure float
  // noise, and a guard that cries wolf gets ignored — which is operationally
  // the same as a guard that cannot fire. That failure mode is the one this
  // project keeps rediscovering, and the rule had it two commits after being
  // written to prevent it.
  //
  // So `realMoved` re-tests each changed instance against the identity itself
  // rather than against its own baseline value. `changed` is still the right
  // input — it is the ordinary value gate and must stay strict — but leaving an
  // identity is a different question from moving at all.

// ============================================================================
// ABSOLUTE IDENTITY CHECK — is the identity TRUE, not merely UNMOVED?
//
// ⚠ THIS RUNS UNCONDITIONALLY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. The BROKEN
// IDENTITIES rule above walks the CHANGED list, so it answers "did this
// depart from baseline" and can only speak when something departed. Two
// consequences, both real:
//
//   1. WHEN NOTHING CHANGES IT CANNOT FIRE, so its silence is not evidence.
//      The entire v20 -> v21 range moved 0 of 15,150 values across seven
//      commits. The relative rule was silent for all seven, and that silence
//      said nothing whatever about whether expectedCombinedRatio was still 1.
//      Verifying it by hand at the v21 recapture was the right instinct and is
//      the reason this section exists.
//
//   2. AN IDENTITY ALREADY WRONG WHEN FIRST BASELINED STAYS WRONG AND SILENT
//      FOREVER. The relative rule requires the baseline to be uniform to arm
//      at all, so a partly-broken identity is invisible to it by construction
//      — it is not in the changed list and it was never uniform.
//
// So: candidates are DETECTED from the baseline (the same uniformity test the
// relative rule uses) and then ASSERTED against the CURRENT capture, every run,
// whether or not anything moved. Case 2 is covered by the SUSPECTED PARTIAL
// section below, which looks for near-uniformity rather than uniformity.
//
// ⚠ AND BIT-EXACTNESS IS CLASSIFIED, NOT PASSED. A genuine identity computed
// two ways carries float noise: expectedCombinedRatio sums per-line terms and
// lands within 2.22e-16 of 1, never ON it. A field that is bit-exact on every
// single instance was not computed twice — it is a value minus itself, an
// inactive quantity, or a pinned constant. That is how Expense Ratio Check
// Difference was caught: exactly 0.0 on 480 of 480 scope-years, against a
// neighbour showing real 1e-16 noise on 289 of the same 480. Passing a
// tautology as a satisfied identity is the failure mode this whole file exists
// to prevent, so bit-exactness is reported separately rather than counted as a
// pass.
//
// ⚠ SCOPE LIMIT, SO THE PRECEDENT IS NOT MISREAD. This section sees RESULTSET
// FIELDS. Expense Ratio Check Difference is an AUDIT-PAGE ROW computed inside
// CalculationAuditPage, so it would never have appeared here — it is named above
// as the archetype of the pattern, not as something this check would have
// caught. Audit-page reconciliations are covered by audit-formula-check, which
// gained its own arms and prose checks for the same reason. Two files, two
// populations; neither is a substitute for the other.
