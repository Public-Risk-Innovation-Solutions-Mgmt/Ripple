// ============================================================================
// ACTUARIAL MEMORANDUM CHECK — the reserve development exhibit, guarded.
//
// Modelled directly on audit-formula-check, and for a stated reason: that page
// reached exit 0 by fixing two classes of defect this exhibit is equally
// exposed to, and both were invisible to the checks that existed at the time.
//
//   A ROW WHOSE NUMBER IS RIGHT AND WHOSE SENTENCE IS WRONG. Reinsurance
//   Recovery's layer count passed the formula check, the hand check and all
//   four arms, because the number was correct and only its prose was not. So
//   every derivable number this memo states in a sentence is registered below
//   as a PROSE CLAIM and evaluated against the data the memo had.
//
//   A ROW CORRECT ONLY BECAUSE THE DEFAULT ZEROED THE TERM IT OMITTED. Six of
//   seven formula defects on that page were invisible at default decisions,
//   because the default pins every CLF to 1.000 and switches the booking bias
//   off. THIS EXHIBIT'S ENTIRE SUBJECT IS WHAT THE BIAS DOES, so a memo built
//   and eyeballed at defaults is a memo tested in the one configuration where
//   the interesting quantity does not exist. Hence the squeezed arm, and hence
//   the coverage assertions at the bottom that FAIL if an arm never produced a
//   matured row, a Prior row, adverse development or a non-zero deficiency.
//
// THREE KINDS OF CHECK, mirroring that page:
//   ARITHMETIC   the row identities, on the RENDERED strings
//   PRINTING     empty-vs-zero discipline, and matured-vs-still-developing
//   PROSE        registered derivable claims
