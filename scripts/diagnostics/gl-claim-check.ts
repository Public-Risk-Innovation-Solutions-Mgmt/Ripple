// Statistical verification of the GL claim-level generator, REBUILT onto a
// fitted per-claim 3-component lognormal mixture (see GL_LOSS_MODEL in
// defaultAssumptions.ts). Replaces the old design-doc-Part-B harness, which
// tested sub-coverages, the liability gate, litigation stages and abuse
// batches — all deleted by this rebuild.
//
// Run: npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/gl-claim-check.ts
//
// STRUCTURE: section 1 replicates the mixture's closed-form moments
// independently of the engine and validates the replica against the real
// exported functions before trusting anything built on them — the same
// discipline wc-severity-rebuild-check.ts used for WC's rebuild. 2 is the
// frequency anchor, 2b is k_GL's identity, 3 the distribution targets, 4 the
// RQ channels, 5 the draw, 6 integrity.
//
// ============================================================================
// EVERY CHECK IS LABELLED [ANALYTIC] OR [DRAWN], AND THAT DISTINCTION MATTERS.
//
//   [ANALYTIC]  closed form vs the spec's own closed form. A real check of the
//               PARAMETERS and the arithmetic; NO check of the generator. It
//               cannot be "suspiciously tight" because no sampling is involved.
//   [DRAWN]     measured from generateGlClaims. Only these test the generator.
//               Each carries a CI, and whether that CI is TRUSTWORTHY depends
//               entirely on whether the quantity has bounded variance:
//                 trustworthy  counts, rates, quantiles, CAPPED means
//                 NOT          any ground-up mean of a heavy-tailed severity
//
// GL's blended CV is 29.55 (component 1 alone: 99.1% of loss at CV 21.5), so a
// ground-up sample mean is dominated by the largest draw seen and CANNOT carry a
// gate at any realistic sample size — finding 26. Ground-up figures here are
// REPORTED with their CI marked untrustworthy; the gates sit on capped means and
// on counts. A previous version of this file mislabelled a circular closed-form
// identity as a verification of the anchor; see section 2.

  // per-claim CV DOES move with the year, because a FIXED ceiling is a
  // shrinking share of an inflating distribution... a CV-indexed GL grid WOULD
  // slide as the book inflates, handing an inflating pool a margin discount for
  // nothing. Any GL CLF grid must either index on something trend-invariant...
  // or carry the year explicitly." It was then asserted as an invariant while
  // the ceiling trended. With the ceiling flat again, the drift is back by the
  // same mechanism, measured below rather than assumed away.
  //
  // THE GRID ITSELF IS LESS EXPOSED THAN THE ORIGINAL WORRY SUGGESTS:
  // glClfGrid indexes on expected claim COUNT, not CV (see its header) — GL
  // frequency is flat and reads real payroll, so the grid's own interpolation
  // AXIS does not move with a fixed cap at all. What is NOT insulated is the
  // grid's stored RATIOS: they were measured once, by single-year draws, on
  // the premise that "drawn/expected is year-invariant" (glClfGrid.ts's own
  // header) — a premise that held automatically under a trending cap and does
  // NOT hold in general under a flat one, because the SHAPE behind each ratio
  // now drifts with year even though the axis it's stored against does not.
  // Whether that drift is large enough to matter over a played game (not the
  // 20-year table below) is exactly the "if the pure premium moves materially,
  // stop and report" question — see the chat report, not this file, for the
  // measured answer and whether it changes the CLF-table decision.
