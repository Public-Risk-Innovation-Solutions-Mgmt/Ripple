// POOL-SCOPE AGGREGATION CHECK — is every pooled field still the thing its name says?
//
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/pool-aggregation-check.ts
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY A COMMENT WAS NOT ENOUGH.
//
// Seven pool-scope aggregation defects reached players, each found by tripping
// over it rather than by looking. THREE of them were added directly underneath
// a comment warning about exactly that class:
//
//   activeExposure / totalMarketExposure   the warning itself (payroll + TIV)
//   writtenExposure                        added later, same defect, NOT named
//                                          by the warning three lines above it
//   cededByLayer                           its justification said "only
//                                          meaningful because WC and GL share
//                                          attachments" — then Property got a
//                                          tower and its $70M xs $5M layer
//                                          landed in the $4M xs $1M cell
//
// A warning naming three fields did not stop the fourth. That is the evidence
// that prose does not hold this line: the failure is always "a field was added
// (or a LINE was added) and nobody re-read the neighbouring comment".
//
// So aggregateLineResults now has NO generic `sum`. Every call names its class —
// addDollars / addEnrolments / addMixedUnitExposure / noPoolMeaning — and this
// script asserts that every numeric field on the pooled row is COVERED by one
// of the four classifications below. A field added to ResultSet without being
// classified here turns this red.
//
// ⚠ THIS CHECKS BOOKKEEPING, NOT TRUTH. It cannot tell you that a field is in
// the wrong class — only that somebody made a choice and wrote it down. The
// value is that adding a field now requires a deliberate act, where before it
// required nothing.
