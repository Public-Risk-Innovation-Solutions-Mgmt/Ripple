// ============================================================================
// THE MARKET DERIVATION — A GATE.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/market-conditions-check.ts
//   GAMES=8 DRAWS=4000 npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/market-conditions-check.ts
//
// marketConditions.ts is a benchmark: every member's grievance is measured
// against it and two more consumers are named to arrive. A benchmark that
// drifts, or that is noisier than the thing it judges, corrupts everything
// downstream of it silently — nothing would fail, members would simply be
// unhappy for a reason nobody chose. So the properties the module's header
// rests on are asserted here rather than argued there.
//
// SEVEN SECTIONS, AND SECTION 5 IS THE ONE A FUTURE COMPONENT WILL MEET.
//
//   1. THE TREND IDENTITY, TO FLOAT. With only the deterministic component,
//      the benchmark must reproduce RATE_NEUTRAL_CHANGE_PCT exactly at every
//      year. Not to a tolerance: the window is fixed-width and the component is
//      a power, so the residual is genuinely zero and anything else is a bug.
//
//   2. EVERY COMPONENT STRICTLY POSITIVE AND MEAN 1. The geometric window needs
//      positivity or it returns 0/NaN, and the whole neutral point rests on the
//      mean. A component with a mean away from 1 retunes the neutral silently,
//      which is the defect RATE_NEUTRAL_CHANGE_PCT exists to prevent.
//
//   3. PURITY. Two calls agree bit-for-bit, and the index is defined at the
//      NEGATIVE pre-game years — which is what makes the window full from year
//      1 rather than filling over the first ten played years.
//
//   4. THE UNBUILT COMPONENTS, PRINTED. An unbuilt component that lives only in
//      a comment is one nobody is reminded of. Two are declared; this says so
//      on every run and prints what each is blocked on.
//
//   5. QUIETER THAN THE RATE IT JUDGES. Per line, the benchmark's own SD must
//      be below the pool's measured rate-change SD. This is the assertion that
//      DISQUALIFIED the calendar component: reserveStepSigma taken at face
//      value puts about 20% SD on WC's market restatement against a pool rate
//      change of 3.4%, and a benchmark four times noisier than its subject
//      makes every grievance a reading of one hashed number.
//
//   6. THE POSITIVE CONTROL. Section 5 has to be shown to fire. A gPool
//      component with its deviation scaled up must red it — a noise test that
//      has never gone red is not a noise test.
//
//   7. THE LEVEL, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT QUANTITY FROM THE OTHER SIX. The change
//      benchmark is derived from mean-1 components; the LEVEL is MODELLED from a
//      target loss ratio that nobody has measured. What is asserted is therefore
//      not its size but its SHAPE and its REACH: the reaction is linear with a
//      kink at zero rather than a copy of the change term's curvature, the
//      cushion is monotone in the funding stop, and the slider can actually
//      spend all of it. That last one is the load-bearing test — the kink at
//      zero is the only place MARKET_TARGET_LOSS_RATIO does any work, so a pool
//      that could never reach it would make the target inert.
//
// ⚠ AND SECTION 7 PRINTS THE PER-LINE CUSHION AT FIVE STOPS ON EVERY RUN. The
// full fourteen-stop table is recorded at marketConditions.ts; this is the
// sampled version, because each stop costs a run of the engine.
//
// ⚠ AND THE RECORDED CALENDAR FIGURES ARE TIED BACK TO THE ENGINE HERE, which
// is the only reason simulationEngine exports reserveStepSigma. The module
// cannot call it (membershipEngine imports the module, so importing the engine
// back would close a cycle), so it carries the numbers and this re-derives them.
// If the IBNER constants move, the rejection argument in that header goes stale
// and this says so.
