// THE EXPERIENCE BASIS — A GATE.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/member-experience-basis-check.ts
//   GAMES=4 YEARS=8 npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/member-experience-basis-check.ts
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT IT GUARDS, AND WHY THE WRONG ANSWER LOOKS RIGHT.
//
// MemberLossYear carries two expected legs. `expectedAtOwnRq` is the
// expectation at the member's ACTUAL risk quality — rq = rqOverride ??
// member.riskQuality, at wcClaimEngine's per-member call and its two
// siblings. `expectedAtManual` is the same call with risk quality alone
// overridden to NEUTRAL_RQ: same k, same year, same class, same exposure.
//
// An experience modifier divides actual by expected. Divide by the leg that
// already contains the member's own risk quality and you have divided out the
// very quality the modifier exists to discover. Measured: ranking power
// against true risk quality on WC over a three-year window is 0.208 on the
// manual basis and 0.120 on the own-RQ basis. The own-RQ basis is the WORST
// of the three available and it is the one an implementation reaches for by
// accident, because the field used to be called `expected` and expected is
// what the formula asks for. Renaming it was the first defence. This is the
// second.
//
// ============================================================================
// 1. DEFINITIONAL — and this is the strong one.
//
// Perturb a member's riskQuality with everything else pinned: same k, same
// year, same seed, same roster. `expectedAtManual` must be BIT-IDENTICAL and
// `expectedAtOwnRq` must move. That is not a threshold, it is the definition
// of the two fields, and it catches the wrong leg being read however the
// mistake arises — a copy, a swapped argument, a lost override.
//
// ⚠ AND IT MUST FAIL IF `expectedAtOwnRq` DOES NOT MOVE. A harness that
// perturbed a risk quality the engine never read would report both legs
// bit-identical and that reads as a pass. The same inert-probe guard
// member-premium-check carries, for the same reason: the dynamic-import
// failure in WORKING_PRACTICES cost nearly exactly this.
//
// This probe cannot hit that failure the same way — it perturbs MEMBER DATA
// passed by argument, not a module constant reached through import() — but
// the guard is cheap and the class of mistake is not confined to imports.
//
// 2. POINT OF EQUALITY. At riskQuality exactly NEUTRAL_RQ the two legs must
// agree to float tolerance; anywhere else they must differ.
//
// This is not a weaker restatement of assertion 1 — it catches a different
// mistake. Assertion 1 only demands that the manual leg be CONSTANT in risk
// quality. A leg overridden to 6 instead of 5, or scaled by a fixed
// relativity, or built from a different exposure basis, is equally constant
// and sails through it. Pinning the two legs to meet at exactly NEUTRAL_RQ
// says WHICH constant: the one the own-RQ expectation itself takes when the
// member sits at neutral. Anchoring it that way also means a change to
// NEUTRAL_RQ moves both sides of the assertion together, so the gate follows
// the engines rather than encoding a 5 of its own.
//
// ============================================================================
// 3. BEHAVIOURAL — the assertion that survives a rewrite.
//
// Assertions 1 and 2 are about the ledger's fields. A modifier could read the
// right field and then recompute the wrong basis three files away. So this
// one measures the OUTCOME: rank members by actual/expected over a rolling
// three-year window, correlate against true risk quality, flip the sign.
//
// TWO CLAUSES, AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE DISCRIMINATOR.
//
//   AN ABSOLUTE FLOOR OF 0.17 ON THE MANUAL BASIS. Recorded at 0.208-0.219
//   from a separate harness; measured here at 0.257 (SE 0.007 across games).
//   Both clear it, so the floor is not fitted to either. It is what catches a
//   global degradation — something that weakens BOTH bases together, which
//   the paired clause below would sail through.
//
//   A PAIRED GAP OF AT LEAST 0.05 BETWEEN THE TWO BASES. Measured here at
//   0.0925 at a three-year window; the recorded pair implies 0.088. This is
//   the clause that fires when the wrong field is read.
//
// ⚠ WHY THE FAILING CASE IS THE GAP AND NOT "OWN-RQ MUST COME IN UNDER 0.17".
// That was the intended shape and this harness does not support it. Measured
// here, WC own-RQ is 0.1643 at a three-year window — 0.006 under the floor —
// and 0.1832 at a five-year window, ABOVE it. A ceiling that a legitimate
// configuration change steps over is not a failing case, it is a flap.
//
// The level and the gap behave completely differently, and that is the whole
// reason for the redesign. Measured across games at a three-year window:
//
//   basis            mean     sd(games)
//   A/EXPOSURE       0.2613   0.0200
//   A/E manual       0.2568   0.0199
//   A/E own-RQ       0.1643   0.0211
//   manual - own-RQ  0.0925   0.0025     <- eight times tighter
//
// The two bases divide the SAME actuals, so pairing them cancels the
// game-to-game variance that dominates either level on its own. The gap sits
// about 100 SE from zero and no single game-year out of 112 has a
// non-positive gap. The levels also carry a harness offset — every figure
// measured here runs about 0.045 above the recorded one, on every basis and
// at every window (own-RQ 0.1235 / 0.1643 / 0.1832 at windows 1 / 3 / 5
// against a recorded 0.099 / 0.120 / —) — while the GAP reproduces to within
// 0.005. So the gap is the quantity that transfers between harnesses and the
// level is not.
//
// 0.05 is a little over half the measured gap, ~47 SE below it, and clear of
// the worst single game (0.0876) by 0.038. It is deliberately not set near
// the measurement.
//
// AND THE GATE CARRIES ITS OWN POSITIVE CONTROL. Substituting the own-RQ leg
// for the manual one is the exact mistake this file exists to catch, so the
// substitution is performed and the gap recomputed: it must come out at zero
// and FAIL. A gate with only a passing case is untested.
