// ============================================================================
// THE WC SAFETY & RETURN-TO-WORK PROGRAM REACHES WC AND NOTHING ELSE — A GATE.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/wc-program-check.ts
//
// Two levers, one program (see riskControlPrograms.ts): SAFETY scales WC's
// arrival rate; RETURN TO WORK converts lost-time claims under $1M to
// medical-only, one for one, AFTER the draw and on its own labelled stream.
// Everything below is a confinement or a phase claim, asserted against paired
// runs rather than argued.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
//   LEVERS      both schedules by tenure, read from the functions the engine
//               calls: safety 0.9875 / 0.97 / 0.95 / 0.95, RTW 0.75c / c / c / c.
//               Other lines read 1 and 0; nothing committed reads 1 and 0; each
//               program leaves the other's line alone.
//   LAPSE       the two halves lapse DIFFERENTLY, and each is asserted alone:
//               safety HALVES each unfunded year (0.5 / 0.25 / 0.125 / 0 of its
//               level), RTW goes to ZERO in the first. A restart resumes safety
//               from its residual and starts RTW's ramp again at 75%.
//   CHARGE      $1M in every committed year and 0 otherwise, flat — no
//               maintenance tier. The engine's riskControlInvestment on WC is
//               exactly that, and GL's and Property's are unmoved by it.
//   NULL INPUT  the generator given multiplier 1 and conversion 0 returns a
//               register bit-identical to one given neither.
//               ⚠ THIS HAS A RESOLUTION FLOOR. It compares the REGISTER, not
//               lambda, so it sees a leak only once the leak changes a Poisson
//               count. Measured by mutation: an explicit 1 read as 1 + 1e-12 or
//               1 + 1e-6 leaves every claim identical and this stays GREEN; at
//               1 + 1e-3 it goes red. The shipped code is exact BY CONSTRUCTION —
//               it multiplies lambda by the value given, and x * 1 === x in IEEE
//               754; a conversion of 0 skips the pass entirely — so the claim
//               holds, but this check alone could not prove it below ~1e-3.
//   NO RE-PHASE conversion alone keeps every claim id, in order; every claim it
//               did not convert is bit-identical; every one it did was a
//               lost-time claim under the ceiling and is now `small`.
//   NO TOWER    conversion alone leaves what the tower cedes EXACTLY unchanged —
//               the reason for the $1M ceiling. ON THE ULTIMATE BASIS (the tower
//               on the drawn claims). Booked development cession is NOT exactly
//               unchanged; see WC_RTW_CONVERSION_CEILING for the measurement.
//   YEAR ONE    ⚠ NOT AT RAMP ZERO, UNLIKE GL. Both WC ramps act from the first
//               year of commitment, so the exact control is a game that commits
//               from YEAR 2: its year 1 is at tenure 0 and must be BIT-IDENTICAL
//               to an unprogrammed game on every line (===, not a tolerance).
//   OTHER LINES with the WC program committed every year, GL's and Property's
//               claims, gross, net, recovery, reserve, premium and roster are
//               bit-identical at every year, and their surplus agrees to a cent
//               (the pool's cross-line cash allocation moves it by ~1e-8 — see
//               otherLineOk).
//   MARKETPLACE the prospect loss ledger is unchanged at every year.
//   DIRECTION   at full effect, claim count falls by about the safety cut, and
//               the realised conversion share of eligible claims is about c.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT ASSERT: that 5% and 10% are the right sizes, or what they
// are worth. That is wc-program-value.ts, a reading with no pass condition.
