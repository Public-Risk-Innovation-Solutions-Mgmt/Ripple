// ============================================================================
// THE CALENDAR BLEND ADDS DISPERSION AND NOT DRIFT — A GATE.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/reserve-centring-check.ts
//   GAMES=120 npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/reserve-centring-check.ts
//
// IBNER_CALENDAR_RHO exists to widen the year-to-year dispersion of the
// reserve-driven residual. The whole mechanism is only legitimate if it leaves
// the LEVEL of that residual where it was, because the pricing is derived from
// the same model: the residual's mean is what forward booking contracts and
// what the premium is set to fund, so a mechanism that moves the mean moves the
// price with it and the pool is no better funded than before, only noisier.
//
// ⚠ SO THE ASSERTION IS ON THE MEAN, AND THE DISPERSION IS A READING. That is
// the opposite way round from what the mechanism is FOR, and deliberately so.
// The dispersion is a calibration — it was solved, it is allowed to drift with
// the engine, and pinning it here would turn every unrelated change into a red
// gate. The mean is a property the mechanism must have BY CONSTRUCTION at any
// rho (see calendarBlendedZ: the blend preserves every cohort's marginal law,
// so E[factor] = 1 exactly), and a break in it means the construction has been
// broken rather than that a number has moved.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE SE IS ACROSS GAMES, NOT ACROSS POOL-YEARS, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS ABOUT
// THREEFOLD. The ten played years of one game share an opening surplus, a
// membership path and a reserve stock that carries from year to year, so their
// residual rates are anything but independent draws. Pooling them as n = GAMES
// x YEARS understates the SE by roughly sqrt(YEARS) and would let this gate
// pass a drift it should have caught. Every figure below is a PER-GAME mean
// first; the statistics are taken over those.
//
// The two arms run on IDENTICAL SEEDS and the difference is taken PAIRWISE per
// game, which removes the game-to-game variation in the level entirely and is
// what makes 40 games enough.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ AND IT CARRIES A POSITIVE CONTROL, BECAUSE A CENTRING GATE WITH ONLY A
// PASSING CASE IS UNTESTED. A gate that asserts "nothing moved" passes just as
// happily when it is measuring the wrong thing, when its SE is inflated, or
// when both arms are accidentally the same arm. Two recorded cases calibrate
// it, both measured at 30 games x 10 years on the shipped engine while this
// mechanism was being chosen:
//
//   phi x2      pool residual mean 29.90% -> 27.86%,  -2.04pp   MUST FAIL
//   IBNER x2    pool residual mean 29.90% -> 29.92%,  +0.02pp   MUST PASS
//
// The phi arm is why this gate exists at all. Widening the per-claim law was
// the obvious way to widen the reserve and it moves the mean by two points,
// through two different mechanisms on two different lines — cession convexity
// on WC (gross mean 28.48% -> 28.70%, i.e. flat, while net falls 24.52% ->
// 22.98%) and the claim-level floors on Property (gross itself falls 22.03% ->
// 19.86%). Neither is visible in a dispersion figure.
//
// WHAT 40 GAMES BUYS, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. At the shipped cell the
// control rejects the -2.04pp drift at -3.94 SE, so the gate has the power it
// was built for. The arms themselves read, at 40 games, POOL +0.99 SE and WC
// +1.75 SE; at 120 games the same comparison reads POOL +1.37 and WC +1.01 SE.
// The 40-game WC figure is noise, not a shrinking bias — raise GAMES if a
// reading here ever looks like it is going somewhere. GL's SE is the loose one
// (its mean is the noisiest of the three) and no sample here tightens it much.
//
// ⚠ THE CONTROL IS APPLIED TO THE DECISION RULE, NOT TO THE ENGINE. It injects
// the recorded -2.04pp into this run's own per-game means and asserts that this
// gate's SE and threshold reject it. That tests the part that can silently be
// wrong — the SE basis and the tolerance — without needing a second mechanism
// in the engine to perturb. If the SE is ever inflated to the point where a two
// point drift would slip through, THIS is the line that goes red.
