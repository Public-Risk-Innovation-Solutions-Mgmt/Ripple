// DOES THE DECISIONS PANEL QUOTE WHAT THE ENGINE CHARGES?

// Run: npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/panel-engine-parity-check.ts
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THIS ASSERTS THE COMPONENTS, NEVER THE COMBINED RATIO. That is the whole
// design of the check, and the reason it exists.
//
// Before this commit the panel priced on the model the engine abandoned: gross
// funding and a percentage-of-premium reinsurance charge. Its combined ratio
// read 100.0% anyway, because it was internally consistent ON ITS OWN GROSS
// BASIS — and when the engine's combined-ratio basis was fixed, the engine
// reached 100.0% too. So the two AGREED on the single summary number anyone
// would have checked, while GL's pool premium rate differed by 73% underneath.
//
// A check on the combined ratio would have passed throughout. Only the
// components reveal it, so only the components are asserted.
// ============================================================================
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THIS GATE WAS RED FOR 62 COMMITS AND SIX DAYS, AND THE CAUSE WAS IN THIS
// FILE. Recorded because the shape of the miss matters more than the miss.
//
//   a9faf09  green, exit 0, both sections, all three lines
//   0a465df  "Price WC on four held class rates" — red on WC, and the same
//            failure signature it still had at b5acdaa
//
// 0a465df gave currentPurePremiumPer100 a members parameter so WC's pure
// premium could blend four held class rates over the enrolled book. It updated
// THREE OF THE FOUR CALL SITES — both engine sites and the panel — and left
// this one. Nothing failed at compile time, because the parameter has a default
// of `[]`, and the default silently means "the full-roster constant" rather
// than "no book supplied".
//
// ⚠ AND THE FILE THIS ONE CHECKS CARRIED A WRITTEN WARNING ABOUT EXACTLY THIS.
// fundingConsequence.ts says, at its own call: "Omitting it would put the panel
// back on the full-market blend and reopen exactly the parity gap this file
// exists to assert against." The warning was correct, it was aimed at the right
// hazard, and the hazard then landed in the checker instead of the checked —
// where the same prose was not read, because nobody was editing this file.
//
// A parameter whose default is a legitimate-looking value cannot be added
// safely by updating the call sites you can think of. See also: this gate was
// not in any sweep at the time, so nothing would have told you either way.
// scripts/gates.ts now runs it.
// ============================================================================
//
// WHAT PARITY MEANS HERE. The panel answers "what would this year cost on the
// book as it stands" — the PRE-MOVEMENT question, since the decision is made
// before the year runs. The engine asks the same question to build the price
// signal members respond to, and that estimate is the referent: parity against
// it must be EXACT (both now call quoteLineRates).
//
// The engine's FINAL premium re-runs the same arithmetic on the POST-movement
// book. The panel cannot know who will join or leave, so that residual is
// structural and is MEASURED here rather than asserted at zero.

// --- 1b. AGAINST THE ENGINE'S STORED OUTPUT, NOT THE SHARED FUNCTION ---------
// Section 1 compares the panel to quoteLineRates, which the panel itself calls
// — so it verifies the panel THREADS its inputs correctly, but it cannot catch
// the shared function being wrong. This one compares against fields the ENGINE
// actually stored on its result, which is an independent referent.
//
// ⚠ members PRE-MOVEMENT, exposure POST-MOVEMENT, and that pairing is not a
// mistake. The engine hoists the tower quote off the pre-movement book and
// reuses it, then divides expected ceded by the POST-movement exposure. Feeding
// the panel anything self-consistent would NOT reproduce the engine; feeding it
// what the engine actually did, does.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THIS SECTION IS RED ON WC AND IS LEFT RED DELIBERATELY. IT IS NOT
// SATISFIABLE AS WRITTEN. Do not "fix" it by changing which book the panel is
// handed — that was tried and it makes things worse. Read this first.
//
// THE ENGINE USES TWO BOOKS, ON PURPOSE, and says so at both sites:
//
//   the occurrence TOWER quote is hoisted off the PRE-movement book and reused
//     rather than re-priced (simulationEngine, "it reads only the pre-movement
//     book and the year, so re-quoting would be a second version of a figure
//     that cannot legitimately differ")
//   the pure-premium BLEND is recomputed on the POST-movement book ("the rate
//     multiplying it has to be the post-movement blend or the two describe
//     different books" — and the first cut of that commit got it wrong by
//     exactly this mixture, worst error 10.8% on a line-year)
//
// THE PANEL HAS ONE `members` FIELD FEEDING BOTH. So on WC — the only line whose
// pure premium reads the book at all — no single choice satisfies this section:
//
//   pre-movement members    expectedCeded PASSES, netPurePremium FAILS
//   post-movement members   netPurePremium's blend is right, but expectedCeded
//                           then breaks on ALL THREE lines, and net = pure -
//                           ceded breaks with it
//
// Measured, not reasoned: feeding post-movement members takes WC's
// netPurePremium from 6,356x the bound to 4,026x and puts GL at 10,226x and
// Property at 122,592x, from green.
//
// ⚠ AND THE PANEL IS NOT WRONG. Its job is the PRE-movement quote — the question
// a player is actually asking, before the year runs — and one book is the right
// answer to that question. Section 1 asserts it exactly and passes. What this
// section tried to assert is exactness between a pre-movement quote and a
// post-movement charge, on a quantity that became book-dependent at 0a465df.
// That claim was true while the blend was roster-blind and is not true now.
//
// THE RESOLUTIONS, none of them taken here because the choice is not this
// commit's to make:
//
//   SPLIT THE PANEL'S BOOK into a tower book and a blend book, so it can
//     reproduce the engine exactly. Costs: a UI-facing signature grows two
//     fields for a diagnostic's benefit, and the panel gains the ability to
//     express a state it should never be in.
//   NARROW THIS SECTION'S CLAIM to the components reproducible from one book
//     (expectedCeded, CLF, reinsuranceCost) and compare the blend separately
//     against a post-movement call. Costs: two referents in one section.
//   MEASURE THE RESIDUAL RATHER THAN ASSERTING IT, as section 2 already does
//     for member movement — this is the same class of gap. Costs: WC's
//     pre-to-post blend drift stops being gated at all.
