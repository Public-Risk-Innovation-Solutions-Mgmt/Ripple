// ⚠ THIS REPLACES membership-equilibrium-report, WHOSE SUBJECT WAS DELETED.
// That file printed the trajectory of a book steered toward
// MEMBERSHIP_EQUILIBRIUM_ENROLLMENT and the k solved to hold it there. There is
// no k and no target. Printing them would be printing a constant that no longer
// exists, which is worse than printing nothing.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT IT ASKS INSTEAD, AND WHY IT IS THE DISCRIMINATOR RATHER THAN A READING.
//
// Intake is now a share of the UNENROLLED marketplace, so it FALLS as the book
// grows. Departures are proportional to the book, so they RISE with it. Two
// opposed flows in one variable cross exactly once:
//
//     APPLICATION_RATE x acceptance x (roster - N)  =  N x (1 - retention)
//
// ⚠ A PLATEAU IS THEREFORE EXPECTED, AND THE QUESTION IS WHERE IT SITS. That is
// the whole test. A book settling at the crossing is two independent rates
// meeting — an outcome. A book settling near 63 would mean something is still
// steering it, because 63 was the deleted target and nothing in the new model
// knows that number. The two look identical on a trajectory chart and are
// completely different mechanisms.
//
// So this reports the crossing MEASURED from the engine's own flows, against
// the crossing PREDICTED by the arithmetic above, and the gap between them is
// the reading. A large gap means something else is acting on the book.
