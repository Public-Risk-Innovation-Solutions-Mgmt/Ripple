// EXPORT SHAPE GUARD — did the export's SHAPE change?
//
// Plays full 5-year games in four line configurations (WC-solo, GL-solo,
// Property-solo, and all three together) across three seeds, exports each
// through the real results workbook, and SHA-256s the PARSED CELL DATA rather
// than the .xlsx wrapper — the wrapper carries timestamps and zip ordering
// that change without the numbers changing, so hashing it would be noise.
//
// ============================================================================
// THIS IS THE SHAPE CHECK, NOT THE VALUE CHECK. Read the same block in
// value-identity-check.ts before "improving" either.
//
// The hash covers VALUES, LABELS, ROW SET AND ORDERING all at once, so it
// cannot say WHICH of them moved. That makes it:
//   - excellent at catching an unintended reorder, a dropped row, or a
//     restructure leaking into another line's math;
//   - useless as a display-layer gate, because renaming a label or adding a
//     metric turns it red by construction while nothing computed has changed.
//
// Its companion, value-identity-check.ts, keys on FIELD NAME and is therefore
// label- and order-independent: it answers "did any VALUE move?" and is the
// PRIMARY gate for display-layer work. Expected pattern for a display fix:
// GREEN there, RED here. For an engine regression: RED there.
//
// Concretely: the expected-combined-ratio fix corrected two exported metrics,
// added one and renamed six labels. All 12 hashes here moved — as they had to —
// while value-identity confirmed 14,400 fields bit-identical. Do NOT re-hash a
// red guard here without first confirming value-identity is green.
// ============================================================================
//
// Purpose: when a change is supposed to touch only one line, the other lines'
// solo hashes must not move. That is the strongest available proof a
// restructure did not leak into the math (see docs/WORKING_PRACTICES.md,
// "Baseline-neutrality is the strongest test for a structural change").
//
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/solo-export-guard.ts            # compare to baseline
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/solo-export-guard.ts --write    # re-capture baseline
//
// ⚠ THE LIVE BASELINE PATH IS THE `BASELINE` CONSTANT BELOW — never this
// comment block. This line used to read "Baseline:
// baselines/SOLO_EXPORT_GUARD_v6.json" and was left behind by six subsequent
// recaptures, pointing at a file that no longer exists while the code read
// v12. Everything from here to the constant is VERSION HISTORY, narrating why
// each baseline was retired; do not read any of it as "the current baseline".
//
// v5 was retired (to v6) by TWO changes landing together, and the order
// matters for reading the movement:
//
//   1. PER-MEMBER RNG STREAMS. Member-level streams moved from one stream per
//      purpose per year (consumed in member order) to one keyed per member, so
//      a member's claims stop depending on who else is enrolled. On its own
//      this reset WC-solo, GL-solo and tri on all three seeds and left PR-solo
//      BYTE-IDENTICAL — Property is not on the claim-generator path, so that
//      invariance was an ASSERTION that no WC/GL stream had leaked into it, and
//      it held.
//   2. THE deriveSubRng FINALIZER (fmix32), which change 1 proved necessary —
//      see finding 26. This one changes seed derivation for EVERY label, so it
//      necessarily moves Property too, including its legacy aggregate path.
//      PR-solo therefore DOES differ from v5 in this baseline. That is expected
//      and is not a leak: the leak check is the one in step 1, and the standing
//      per-key dispersion regression test now guards the finalizer.
//
// See scripts/diagnostics/enrolment-independence-check.ts for both.
//
// STAYED AT v6 THROUGH THE MARKETPLACE-WIDE GENERATION CHANGE. That change
// generates claims for all 200 members, but per-member stream keying keeps every
// enrolled draw identical and prospect losses never reach an exported figure, so
// all 12 hashes were byte-identical. value-identity moved to v7 only to absorb 60
// new kLineApplied fields, which are not exported. Recapturing here would have
// written a duplicate file under a new name, so that version skew was deliberate.
//
// v7 retired here (moved to v8) by CLF-ONLY PRICING: the Rate Change decision
// was deleted (removes an exported field on every line — a real shape change)
// and the funding-confidence-level default moved 0.75 -> 0.60 (a real value
// change on every remaining pricing/surplus/membership figure — confirmed by
// isolation test in value-identity-check.ts's header). All 12 hashes moved.
//
// v8 retired here (moved to v9) by two corrections to that same work, each
// isolated separately in value-identity-check.ts's header: the
// fundingConfidenceLevel satisfaction term neutralised (it had gone live and
// backwards at the new 0.60 default) and FUNDING_CLF_TABLE[0.60] aligned to
// the reference chart's 1.000 (was 1.003). Both touch every line via the
// shared membershipEngine.ts / lookupCLF paths, so all 12 hashes moved again,
// PR-solo included — expected here, unlike the per-member-stream work above
// where PR-solo staying still was the specific leak check.
//
// v9 retired here (moved to v10) by the WC CLASS COST REBUILD: every WC class
// frequency, every per-class tier mix, and the temp/perm severity parameters
// re-anchored to WCIRB advisory pure premium rates for public-entity
// classifications. Class claim counts move 838.2 -> 1825.6/yr and the
// catastrophic tier drops 3.3214 -> 0.8935/yr.
//
// EXACTLY 6 OF 12 HASHES MOVED — WC-solo and tri on all three seeds. GL-solo
// AND PR-SOLO STAYED BYTE-IDENTICAL, which is the point: this change touches
// only WC_LOSS_MODEL, and neither of the other two lines reads it. That
// invariance is the leak check, exactly as it was for the per-member-stream
// work above, and it is a stronger scope statement than value-identity can
// make (value-identity aggregates across configs, so WC's movement shows up
// there as 4,395 changed fields with 0 added and 0 removed).
//
// v4 was retired by roster v4
// (TIV-only rescale, see roster_canonical_v4.csv), and v3 before that by the
// expected-combined-ratio fix, which added one exported metric, corrected two
// values and renamed six labels — a legitimate export-shape change with no
// engine movement behind it (proven by value-identity-check).
//
// Baselines are RETIRED at every roster version — v2 moved payroll, TIV and
// Region; v3 decorrelated risk quality from member type and added the
// Locations / Primary Asset Share columns; v4 rescaled TIV per member type
// (total $6,993.3M -> $14,303.5M) to fix an insured-value plausibility
// failure, touching NO other column. Every Property-derived number
// legitimately changed each time, so no earlier-version hash can ever match
// again. WC and GL are the control: value-identity-check confirms their
// solo-game fields never move across any of these roster revisions, because
// neither line's generator reads TIV.
//
// v10 retired here (moved to v11) by EIGHT ENGINE COMMITS, recaptured
// together rather than after each one: aa0838a (per-occurrence reinsurance
// tower for WC AND GL, replacing the old aggregate quota-share model on both
// lines) through a08b88e (wage inflation on WC's exposure base) — full list
// in the recapture commit and in value-identity-check.ts's matching v11 note.
//
// EXACTLY 9 OF 12 HASHES MOVED — WC-solo, GL-solo and tri on all three seeds.
// PR-SOLO STAYED BYTE-IDENTICAL ON ALL THREE, which is the leak check: none
// of the eight commits touch Property, and this proves it. GL-solo moving is
// expected and not a leak — aa0838a rebuilt GL's reinsurance mechanism too,
// not just WC's, so GL's export legitimately changed shape and value. See
// value-identity-check.ts's v11 note for the field-level detail: this is a
// real reinsurance-model movement, not a restructuring leak.
//
// v11 retired here (moved to v12) by SIX COMMITS, recaptured together:
// 23da65c (GL's four sub-coverages replaced by a fitted per-claim mixture —
// claimCountsBySub removed, claimCount added), 72ecaa0 (k_GL neutralises the
// severity tilt, matching WC), 4f695a0 (GL severity trend + payroll growth),
// 326e275 (GL severity capped at $100M, both draw and analytic side), c1cec1b
// (GL's own derived CLF grid, replacing the generic FUNDING_CLF_TABLE for
// GL), and a21d01b (an "Expected" funding option added to WC AND GL,
// defaulting BOTH lines to a computed CLF = 1.000 in place of a fixed
// percentile stop). Also absorbs 8c0ae6f (the Welcome-to-Ripple setup-screen
// squash-merge) — CONFIRMED GATE-INERT before this recapture: this script's
// and value-identity-check's full stdout were diffed byte-for-byte against
// a21d01b and came back empty, so 8c0ae6f contributes nothing here.
//
// EXACTLY 9 OF 12 HASHES MOVED — WC-solo, GL-solo and tri on all three seeds.
// PR-SOLO STAYED BYTE-IDENTICAL ON ALL THREE, the leak check: none of the six
// commits (nor the UI squash) touch Property.
//
// WC-SOLO'S MOVEMENT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXACTLY ONE MECHANISM, confirmed by
// bisection in a worktree: WC-solo still MATCHED v11 through c1cec1b (the
// first five of the six commits are GL-only — by inspection of each diff and
// by the hash holding) and diverged for the first time at a21d01b. That
// commit's only WC-facing code change is one ternary in
// simulationEngine.ts's selectedFundingCLF dispatch —
// `lineDecisions.fundingAtExpected ? 1.0 : computeWcClf(...)` — the Expected
// funding default replacing WC's old 60%-stop default. Nothing else in that
// commit touches WC.
//
// GL-solo moving is not a leak: five of the six commits ARE GL's own rebuild
// (fitted-mixture severity, k_GL neutralisation, severity trend, the $100M
// cap, GL's own CLF grid), and the sixth (a21d01b) moves GL's default the
// same way it moves WC's.
//
// v12 retired here (moved to v13) by ONE COMMIT: f5ece4d, which moved BOTH
// lines from frozen per-layer reinsurance constants (expectedCededPer100,
// sdOverExpected) to runtime computation of E[ceded] and SD[ceded] from the
// enrolled book and the current year, plus a fix to the WC aggregate's
// occurrence-frequency basis (nominal exposure -> real payroll x
// wcFrequencyTrend). This is a PRICING-BASIS change, not a loss-model change —
// no claim generator, severity, frequency or roster parameter moved. See
// towerMoments.ts's header for the full argument.
//
// EXACTLY 9 OF 12 HASHES MOVED — WC-solo, GL-solo and tri on all three seeds,
// the same shape as v11->v12 despite this being a single commit rather than
// six, because a reinsurance-cost change reaches the same three configs a
// funding-default change does. PR-SOLO STAYED BYTE-IDENTICAL ON ALL THREE —
// Property runs the legacy REINSURANCE_PROGRAMS path and was not reached. That
// is the leak check for this recapture, and it held.
//
// v13 retired here (moved to v14) by EIGHT COMMITS: 875cb75 (memoize five
// pure-function-of-year trends — a caching change, confirmed inert by hash),
// fdc747c (scale member joins with the remaining marketplace), bdc98ec
// (reconnect the price channel to membership), fab85e4 (fund the pool premium
// net of expected ceded), f328d65 (replace the CLF grids with static
// backtested tables), 3d3fbcc (install a supplied static CLF table for GL),
// 962ef60 (remove WC's report lag and IBNR), and a3d7760 (decouple the
// opening position from the reserve margin, testing against premium instead).
//
// PR-SOLO CHECKED PER COMMIT, NOT JUST AT THE ENDPOINTS, because membership
// and pricing are shared machinery this time rather than a WC/GL-only
// mechanism — the v13 assumption that Property is untouched until the last
// commit does NOT hold here. Re-running this guard at every intermediate
// commit: 875cb75 leaves PR-solo byte-identical (the memoization touches only
// WC's and GL's own claim engines); fdc747c and bdc98ec each move PR-solo on
// all three seeds, exactly as their own commit messages claim ("no line is an
// untouched control... PR-solo will NOT hold"); fab85e4, f328d65, 3d3fbcc and
// 962ef60 leave PR-solo byte-identical again (net funding explicitly does not
// touch Property's legacy aggregate; the CLF table swaps are WC/GL-only; the
// IBNR removal is WC-only); a3d7760 moves PR-solo on 2 of 3 seeds — the third
// (6KA6WGLJ) happened to accept the same pre-game attempt under both the old
// margin-basis and the new premium-basis band, so its history is genuinely
// unchanged, not a leak that got lucky. Property therefore moves at TWO points
// in this chain, not one: the membership/pricing commits and the opening-band
// commit, each for a documented shared-machinery reason.
//
// SHAPE, NOT JUST VALUES: 962ef60 deletes wcIbnr.ts and its four fields
// (ibnrReserve, ibnrAccrual, emergedPriorYearLoss, unreportedClaimCount) —
// see the matching note in value-identity-check.ts. Invisible to THIS guard on
// every config, including WC-solo: none of the four was ever in RESULT_METRICS
// (checked against 962ef60^'s resultMetrics.ts — zero matches), so they never
// reached the exported workbook this script hashes. value-identity-check sees
// them because it reads the raw LineResultSet object directly, where all three
// lines carried them (0 on GL/Property, "which have no report lag" per the old
// type comment) — that is why it reports exactly 150 instances per field, the
// same count as any other fully-populated field, not a WC-only 30 or 60.

// v19: retired v18 at the feature/ibner merge. All 12 hashes moved, and they are
// PURE VALUE MOVEMENT — RESULT_METRICS is byte-for-byte unchanged across the
// whole range, so nothing was added, dropped or reordered in the export.
//
// ⚠ THIS GUARD SAW NOTHING OF THE RANGE'S ACTUAL SHAPE CHANGE. ReserveCohort
// gained registerSum/horizon/age/stepMultiplier/bookingBias and lost
// developmentFactor; ReserveDevelopmentState was deleted. All of it is outside
// RESULT_METRICS, so this guard is blind to it by construction — fifth time that
// has mattered. "Shape identity" here means the shape of the EXPORT, not of the
// model behind it.
// v20: retired v19 at the pool-scope aggregation audit. ALL 12 HASHES MOVED and
// PR-solo moving is NOT a leak here — the export gained an `Enrolments` column
// and renamed `Active Members` to `Members`, and a new row plus a relabel reach
// every configuration by construction. The solo hashes moved on SHAPE alone:
// value-identity reads 0 changed in all three solo configs and 0 at every line
// scope, with movement confined to 37 pool-scope membership fields in `tri`.
//
// The two columns are deliberate and are not duplicates. Members is the distinct
// roster; Enrolments is that roster summed per line (141 against 205 on a
// three-line book). Enrolments ships because it is the DIVISOR behind Member
// Satisfaction and Average Risk Quality — drop it and neither is
// reconstructable from the export; drop Members and the export reads 205 where
// every page reads 141, which is the divergence this closed.
// v21: retired v20 across seven commits, and ALL 12 HASHES WERE ALREADY MATCHING
// AT EVERY ONE OF THEM. This recapture changes no hash — it exists only so the
// version pair stays aligned with value-identity, which had a stale shape line to
// clear.
//
// ⚠ THE HASHES WERE CHECKED PER COMMIT ANYWAY, 84 in total (7 x 12), because the
// range is entirely display and diagnostic work on the Calculation Audit page —
// and a page that renders exported figures is exactly where a display fix could
// reach the export without anyone expecting it. It did not: every configuration
// at every commit is byte-identical.
//
// That is a stronger statement than "the endpoint is clean". A display change
// that broke and then repaired an export would show as clean at the endpoint and
// red in the middle; nothing here was red in the middle.
// v22: ALL 12 HASHES CHANGE, for the first time since the engine last moved.
// Claim-level development cession reaches every line and every config; there is
// no control here and none is expected. The null test is the mechanism switch —
// with DEVELOPMENT_CESSION_ENABLED false, all 12 match v21 byte for byte.
// v23: 12 hashes become 24 — this guard gained a SQUEEZED ARM. The 12 `def|`
// hashes are byte-identical to v22; the 12 `sqz|` hashes are new. Verified
// before capture, not after.
//
// v24: ALL 24 HASHES MOVE AND NO ENGINE VALUE DOES. RESULT_METRICS gained three
// columns and renamed two labels, so the workbook's values, labels and row set
// all changed while value-identity-check read 0 of 28,800 changed on both arms.
// That pair — every hash moving, every value holding — is the signature of an
// export-only change, and it is the only reading under which a 24-hash move is
// not alarming.
// v25: all 24 hashes move on a REMOVED COLUMN. shockLossAmount left
// RESULT_METRICS, so the workbook's row set changed while value-identity read 0
// changed of 28,500. Recaptured in the same commit rather than deferred to the
// next range: a guard left red for everyone is a guard people learn to skip, and
// this file's own history has the phantom "removed 300" line as the case study.
// v30: all 24 hashes moved. The developing subset is reselected as claims close,
// so the claim register's values change and every workbook that reads them
// changes with it. The SHAPE is unchanged — no column added, renamed or
// reordered — which is what this guard is for and what distinguishes this from
// v24, where the shape moved and no value did. See VALUE_IDENTITY_v30's note for
// the control that attributes the value change: closure forced off reproduces
// v29 bit for bit.
// v31: all 24 hashes moved, shape unchanged. The claim register's values change
// because the developing set is sized differently and the spill no longer
// reaches settled claims; no column was added, renamed or reordered. See
// VALUE_IDENTITY_v31's note for the three causes and how each was measured.
// v32: all 24 hashes moved. Which claims develop is redrawn every valuation, so
// the claim register's values change and every workbook reading them changes
// with it. Shape unchanged — no column added, renamed or reordered.
// v33: 12 of 24 moved — every GL-solo and every tri, while all 6 WC-solo and all
// 6 PR-solo stayed byte-identical. GL's occurrence id became per-member and
// closure hashes the id; the two untouched lines are what says the change did
// not leak past GL.
// v34: ALL 24 MOVED, shape unchanged — no column added, renamed or reordered.
// STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM was re-centred, the pre-game search accepts a
// different attempt, and a different past is simulated on every seed. A capture
// where some export held still would be the surprising one here.
//
// ⚠ AND THE SHAPE CLAIM IS MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED. dbcfed7 added
// rcEffectivenessApplied to the line result one commit earlier and this guard
// read 24 of 24 MATCH at that commit — so the field reaches no export, and the
// 24 hashes moving now carry no column change hidden inside them.
// v35: ALL 24 MOVED, AND THE SHAPE CHANGED — two columns added. The loss-ratio
// basis fix puts actualLossRatioPricingBasis and actualLossRatioRetainedPremium
// on the result and resultMetrics exports both, so every sheet gains two
// columns and every hash moves with them.
//
// ⚠ THE COLUMN ADDITION IS WHY 24 OF 24 MOVED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE
// EXPLANATION. Read this capture together with the v35 value-identity capture,
// which measured 0 of 29,580 existing values changed. A hash guard cannot tell
// "two columns appended" from "every number changed"; the value capture can,
// and it says the second did not happen. Neither capture is sufficient alone
// here — that pairing is the argument.
// v36: ALL 24 MOVED, AND THE SHAPE CHANGED — one ROW removed. Underwriting
// Strictness is retired (above strictness 6 it sorted applicants on the
// member's true risk quality and kept the best 60%, which is exact selection
// on an attribute the player can no longer see), so its resultMetrics entry
// goes and every sheet loses that row.
//
// ⚠ THE DIFF WAS TAKEN RATHER THAN INFERRED, and it is two lines. One export
// (MAMC6EA4, WC-solo, default arm) rendered at the parent commit and at this
// one differs by exactly:
//
//   8d7   < Decisions,Underwriting Strictness,5.00,5.00,5.00,5.00,5.00
//   98d96 < Decisions,Underwriting Strictness,5.00,5.00,5.00,5.00,5.00
//
// — one row per sheet, nothing else, on a 180-line export. Read together with
// value-identity, which is GREEN across this change: no simulated value moved,
// which is what makes a 24-of-24 hash move safe to recapture. The pairing is
// the argument, exactly as at v35.
//
// ⚠ AND THE ENGINE PATH WAS CHECKED SEPARATELY, because retiring the slider
// deleted a branch inside simulateMemberMovement. The old code shuffled the
// candidate pool ONLY on the else branch, so a game above strictness 6
// consumed no shuffle; the shuffle is unconditional now. Every configuration
// here runs at the default of 5, which always took the else branch, so the
// RNG stream is untouched — and value-identity agreeing is the measurement
// that says so rather than the reasoning.
// v37: ALL 24 MOVED, ON VALUES THIS TIME RATHER THAN ON SHAPE. The departure
// rebuild changes WHICH members leave, so a different book is enrolled from
// year 1 and every export figure follows. No column was added or removed —
// the shape is identical to v36 and the row count is unchanged.
//
// ⚠ AND THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF v36, WHICH IS WHY THE PAIR MATTERS. At v36
// all 24 moved and NO value changed (a retired decision row came out); here
// all 24 moved and 22,174 values changed with the shape held. A hash guard
// reports the same thing in both cases. value-identity v37 is what separates
// them, and its note records the confinement check: every changed field is
// downstream of the roster, nothing roster-independent moved, no NaN.
// v48: WC'S OPENING SURPLUS BAND RE-TRANSLATED ONTO ITS CURRENT J AND ITS PIN
// RE-SOLVED WITH IT. EXACTLY 12 OF 24 MOVED — WC-solo on all three seeds and tri
// on all three, in BOTH arms. GL-SOLO AND PR-SOLO ARE BYTE-IDENTICAL, all 12 of
// them, and that is the leak check and the strongest available statement of
// scope: the band, the pin and the frozen J are per-line literals, WC's were the
// only ones touched, and nothing reached the other two lines. No column was
// added or removed.
//
// ⚠ THE SPLIT NEEDED NO INTERPRETATION, which is the case for keeping a guard
// whose unit is the whole export. The changed set is exactly {WC-solo, tri} and
// the unchanged set is exactly {GL-solo, PR-solo} — a partition along the line
// that was edited, with nothing on the wrong side of it. value-identity v48
// reports the same change as 2,084 fields on the capital chain but is
// POOL-LEVEL, so it cannot say which LINE moved; this one can, and does.
//
// v47: GL'S TRIANGLE CONTRACTION RE-SOLVED (A +6.44%, closing a 6%
// mean-preservation failure). EXACTLY 6 OF 12 MOVED — GL-solo on all three seeds
// and tri on all three. WC-SOLO AND PR-SOLO ARE BYTE-IDENTICAL. This is the
// MIRROR IMAGE of v46, where WC moved and GL did not, and the pair is worth
// reading together: the same guard proved the WC year factor did not reach GL,
// and now proves the GL contraction does not reach WC. Neither claim is argued.
//
// v46: WC'S AGGREGATE LOSS VOLATILITY RAISED TO 0.30 via a shared year factor.
// EXACTLY 6 OF 12 CONFIGURATIONS MOVED — WC-solo on all three seeds and tri on
// all three. GL-SOLO AND PR-SOLO ARE BYTE-IDENTICAL, which is the leak check and
// the strongest available statement of scope: the factor is drawn on WC's own
// RNG label and is NOT the shared gPool, so GL keeps its own year factor
// untouched and nothing reaches Property at all. Had the change consumed gPool
// instead — the cheaper implementation — GL-solo would necessarily have moved,
// and these six identical hashes are what proves it did not.
//
// v45: WC TOOK A SUPPLIED CLF CURVE, and the surplus limb was re-solved behind
// it. 12 of 24 exports moved, against all 24 at v44 — and the SPLIT IS EXACT,
// which is the isolation claim holding at the export level rather than being
// argued for. WC-solo 6 of 6 changed, tri (all three lines) 6 of 6 changed,
// GL-solo 0 of 6, PR-solo 0 of 6. Every export that moved contains WC and every
// export that did not contains no WC. Nothing leaked sideways. GL's and
// Property's per-band label errors are bit-identical across the swap (GL -9.4 /
// -9.0 / -8.0), and ending surplus at Expected is bit-identical on all three
// lines, so what moved moved through reserveMarginCLF on WC alone.
//
// v44: WC'S CLF TABLE RE-DERIVED AT THE SMALL BAND, so the label is honest for
// the shipped default's frozen ~62-member book.
//
// ⚠ ALL 24 MOVED AND THAT IS MORE THAN THE CHANGE ITSELF WARRANTS, WHICH IS
// WORTH SAYING BECAUSE value-identity MOVED ONLY 3,948 OF 31,200 FIELDS on the
// same commit. These exports are hashes over whole workbooks: a single moved
// cell in a shared summary re-hashes the sheet, so this guard cannot express
// "WC only". value-identity is the instrument that can, and it says the movement
// is confined to the fields that read the table — fundingGap and
// capitalFundingGap lead its list.
//
// ⚠ SO GL-SOLO AND PR-SOLO MOVING IS NOT A LEAK, AND THE PROOF IS NEXT DOOR
// rather than here. Read them together: RED here plus a narrow, named field set
// there is the expected signature of a constant that only some code paths
// consult. At all-defaults fundingAtExpected pins CLF to 1.000 and the table is
// never read at all.
//
// v43: ALL 24 MOVED. NO NEW BUSINESS AS THE DEFAULT APPETITE — intake stops on
// every line in every configuration, so no solo game can be exempt.
//
// ONE CAPTURE FOR FOUR COMMITS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM MOVES A NUMBER:
//   dab4d62  save-round-trip-check's controls made deterministic  (diagnostic only)
//   81e68da  newBusinessAppetite defaults to NO_NEW_BUSINESS      (the engine change)
//   9c5e18d  the CLF re-derivation measured and declined          (two records only)
//   this one recapture
//
// ⚠ AND THE OPENING POSITION IS UNCHANGED, WHICH IS WHAT SEPARATES THIS CAPTURE
// FROM v42's. That one moved every export through the OPENING — a frozen roster
// and a re-solved pin on all three lines. This one moves them through the PLAYED
// YEARS only: the pre-game is frozen structurally, so the appetite default
// cannot reach it, and the year-1 book is identical member for member. A
// reader diffing two exports across this pair should expect year 1 to agree and
// the divergence to open from year 2.
//
// v42: ALL 24 MOVED, AND AGAIN THERE IS NO CONTROL — for the same reason as
// v41 and one more. The pre-game roster is frozen (no joins, departures or
// declines in the ten pre-game years), so the opening book every export is
// built from is now the starting enrolment rather than ten years of accumulated
// intake. That reaches every line in every configuration by construction.
//
// AND STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM was re-solved on ALL THREE LINES behind it —
// WC 0.2503 -> 0.3254, GL 0.1418 -> 0.2027, Property 0.6231 -> 0.5452 — which
// on its own moves every opening position. Property has never moved in a
// previous pin re-solve and it moves here, so it cannot serve as the control it
// served as at v40.
//
// ⚠ THE TWO CANNOT BE SEPARATED IN THIS CAPTURE AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
// Freezing the roster is what put the pin out of centre (-6.1 / -6.3 / +4.0 SE
// on opening-centring-check), so shipping the freeze without the re-solve would
// ship a red gate. See value-identity-check's matching v42 note.
//
// v41: ALL 24 MOVED, AND THERE IS NO CONTROL THIS TIME. Voluntary departures
// were switched off (VOLUNTARY_DEPARTURES_ENABLED = false), so the only way out
// of the pool is a renewal decline.
//
// ⚠ THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROL IS ITSELF THE EXPECTED RESULT, WHICH IS NOT THE
// USUAL SITUATION IN THIS FILE. v39 held six exports and v40 held the three
// Property-solo ones, and in both cases the line that did not move was the line
// the change did not reach. Nothing is exempt here: departures ran on every
// line, in every solo game, and — because priorHistoryEngine plays ten pre-game
// years through the same processYear — in the pre-game that builds every
// opening position too. A Property-solo export holding would have been the
// finding, not the control.
//
// Property has no rated members and therefore no adverse SELECTION, but the
// departure COUNT never depended on selection: it is book x (1 - retentionProb)
// and Property paid it like everything else. That distinction is exactly what
// the count/selection split in memberDeparture.ts's header describes, and this
// capture is where it becomes visible.
//
// v40: ALL 24 MOVED. STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM was re-solved (WC 0.3250 ->
// 0.2503, GL 0.2062 -> 0.1418), which changes which pre-game attempt the band
// accepts and therefore the whole opening position every export is built from.
//
// ⚠ AND THE SIX THAT HELD ARE THE CONTROL AGAIN, ON A DIFFERENT LINE. Every
// PROPERTY-SOLO export is bit-identical across the change, both arms, all three
// seeds. Property's pin is the one that was NOT re-solved — it read -0.032
// against a 0.143 tolerance and was left alone — and in a Property-solo game no
// other line's opening exists to perturb it. So the per-line pin behaves per
// line, exactly as the constant claims.
//
// That is the same shape as v39, where the six GL-solo exports held because GL's
// curve was untouched. Two consecutive captures have now carried a bit-identical
// subset that names the untouched thing, which is worth more than the eighteen
// diffs each time: it bounds the change from the outside rather than arguing
// about it from the inside.
//
// ⚠ I PREDICTED THE OPPOSITE AND WAS WRONG, recorded because the reasoning is a
// trap worth marking. The first draft of this note said PR-solo would move
// anyway, on the grounds that Property shares a pool-level cash split and starts
// from an instanceGenerator opening whose other lines moved. In a SOLO
// configuration there are no other lines — that is what solo means — so neither
// half applied. The structural argument at value-identity v40 stands on its own
// (two read sites, both opening-position constructors, none in simulationEngine),
// but it did not need to: the control was there to be measured.
// v39: 18 OF 24 MOVED, AND THE SIX THAT DID NOT ARE THE CONTROL.
// The CLF tables were re-derived. Every WC-solo, every Property-solo and every
// tri export moved, in both arms. ALL SIX GL-SOLO EXPORTS MATCH BIT-FOR-BIT.
//
// That is not luck and it is worth more than the 18 diffs. GL prices off
// GL_SUPPLIED, a real-pool curve the re-derivation deliberately did not touch,
// and GL's 90% stop (1.5020, the reserve risk margin) is therefore unchanged
// too. GL_DERIVED moved a long way — its 99th stop went 6.5251 -> 1.4523 — and
// it is exported from clfTables.ts, so if anything on the export path were
// reading the derived curve instead of the supplied one, these six would have
// moved. They did not. The only consumer of GL_DERIVED is
// gl-supplied-clf-check.ts, exactly as its comment claims.
//
// So this capture carries its own negative control: a table change that reaches
// two lines and provably does not reach the third.
// v48 was retired (to v49) by a SHAPE CHANGE AND A RENAME, AND BY NO VALUE AT
// ALL — which is the whole of what the diff shows and is why it was safe to
// recapture. All 24 exports moved; dumped at full stored precision on both
// sides and compared line for line, the difference on every sheet is exactly:
//
//   1. ONE ADDED ROW, `Net Incurred Loss (the loss-ratio numerator)`, under
//      Losses. RESULT_METRICS carried netUltimateLoss and no netIncurredLoss,
//      while all three actual loss ratios divide the latter — so the workbook
//      could not reproduce its own ratios. Measured before the fix: the loss
//      shown over the denominator shown missed the ratio shown by 32.7 to 40.1
//      percentage points across five years, and by a mean of 35.3pp over 60
//      pool-years. After it, the division reproduces to six decimal places.
//   2. ONE RENAMED LABEL, `Actual Loss Ratio (pricing basis)` ->
//      `... (pricing basis — premium + admin expense)`, so the row names its
//      own denominator. ⚠ ITS VALUES ARE BYTE-IDENTICAL ON BOTH SIDES —
//      1.1154327323013637 before and after — which is the evidence that this
//      recapture carries no engine movement hiding behind a shape change.
//
// Nothing else differs: 356 lines became 360, and the four new lines are the
// added row on the Pool sheet and on each of the three line sheets.

// v50 was retired (to v51) by THREE ADDED ROWS AND NO VALUE AT ALL.
// RESULT_METRICS gained `retainedCoverMargin`, `poolLayerLossRatio` and
// `totalLossRatioGross`; all 24 exports moved because every sheet gained three
// lines. ⚠ THAT NO VALUE MOVED IS NOT ASSERTED HERE BUT PROVED NEXT DOOR:
// value-identity-check HOLDS across its 150 instances on the same commit, and
// it covers every computed value, so an export built from those values cannot
// have moved one. The default game places the whole tower, so
// retainedCoverMargin reads $0 in every captured export — the row is there for
// the games where it is the explanation.

// ⚠ v51 -> v52: THE PROPERTY MERGE. All 24 exports moved, and THEY DID NOT ALL
// MOVE FOR THE SAME REASON — which is the distinction this guard cannot draw on
// its own and must be read with value-identity v50 to draw at all.
//   WC-solo, GL-solo (6 of 24)   SHAPE ONLY. Every value in these two
//       configurations is BIT-IDENTICAL across the merge — value-identity
//       reports 0 of 5970 and 0 of 6000 moved. The hash moves because the
//       workbook gained three rows (Retained Cover Margin and the two loss
//       ratios) and an Event column, and lost two (Shock Loss Incurred,
//       Catastrophe Factor). Not one number on either line changed.
//   PR-solo, tri (18 of 24)      SHAPE AND VALUE. Property's frequency and
//       severity recalibration moves 69.8% of PR-solo's values.
// A recapture that could not say which of those two things happened would be
// the blank cheque this file's header warns about. It can, so it is not.
// ⚠ v52 -> v53: THE INVESTMENT RETURN CUT. All 24 exports move, and unlike v52
// they ALL move for the SAME reason and it is a VALUE reason, not a shape one:
// no row is added, removed or renamed by this change. Every workbook carries
// investment income, invested assets, surplus and the funding figures derived
// from them, and INVESTMENT_RETURN_SCALE moves all of those on every line of
// every configuration.
//
// ⚠ AND THE CHARGES IN THESE WORKBOOKS MOVE TOO, WHICH IS NOT PRICING. These
// are free-running games, so they go through runLinePreGame's acceptance search,
// which selects a past on ENDING SURPLUS / premium — a quantity that contains
// investment income. A different rate can accept a different past, and the
// opening roster changes with it. value-identity v51's note carries the
// isolating test: replayed from an IDENTICAL past, charges, pool premium and
// membership are bit-identical in 24 of 24 games while investment income differs
// in 24 of 24. Read the two captures together, as v52 said to.
