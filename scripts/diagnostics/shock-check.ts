//
// TWO JOBS, AND THE FIRST ONE MATTERS MORE.
//
// 1. THE NULL-EFFECT GATE. Shock machinery that changes default behaviour is a
//    defect, and the most dangerous version of that defect is an RNG stream
//    shift, which moves every seed while looking like a rounding difference.
//    This harness plays real games three ways — field absent, field present but
//    empty, and a scheduled shock — and asserts the first two are IDENTICAL
//    across every numeric field of every line and year.
//
//    The two export gates (value-identity-check, solo-export-guard) already
//    cover the field-absent case, since they construct instances through the
//    real generateGameInstance. What they cannot cover is `scheduledShocks: []`,
//    because nothing constructs that. This does.
//
// 2. WHAT EACH EVENT COSTS, AT BOTH BASES. Full market AND the enrolled pool.
//    A treaty-facing or premium-facing figure quoted at full-market scale runs
//    roughly 4x high, and this project has made that mistake more than once.
//
// CALIBRATION IS DEFERRED, DELIBERATELY. Nothing here asserts that an event's
// cost is the RIGHT cost for its band. The pool currently cannot lose money at
// default decisions (finding 24) and that is being fixed on the economics side;
// tuning shocks against a pool that cannot lose would make the game brutal the
// moment it can. Costs are REPORTED. The balance decision stays open.

  // ⚠ THIS ASSERTION CHANGED WITH THE WC SEVERITY REBUILD, and the change is a
  // real consequence rather than a relaxation. It used to require every year but
  // the shock year to be byte-identical, on the reasoning that "a current-horizon
  // event that leaks forward would be indistinguishable from a future-horizon
  // one". That reasoning was correct when every claim reported in its accident
  // year. It no longer is:
  //
  //   #28 raises the arrival rate of WC's HEAVY component for one year. 18% of
  //   heavy-component claims report LATE. So the extra claims the shock causes in
  //   Y2 keep EMERGING through Y3, Y4 and Y5 — the pool learns about them later.
  //
  // That is what a report lag means, and a current-horizon shock now genuinely
  // has a multi-year reported tail. It is still distinguishable from a
  // future-horizon event: the DRAW is confined to the shock year (Y3+ opens
  // independent per-member streams), so the later movement can only be positive
  // and must decay as the lag distribution runs off. Both are asserted.
  //
  // ⚠ BOTH LINES NOW TAKE THE SAME TEST, AND GL'S OLD ONE WAS A BOOK-SIZE
  // ASSUMPTION IN DISGUISE. It required GL gross to be BIT-IDENTICAL after the
  // shock year, on the reasoning that GL has no report lag so there is no
  // emergence tail. The first half is right and the conclusion did not follow:
  // there is a second channel, and it is MEMBERSHIP. A shock moves losses,
  // losses move satisfaction and retention, and a different book writes
  // different business in every later year.
  //
  // That assertion passed for as long as the book could not move. Intake was a
  // demand term pinned to MEMBERSHIP_EQUILIBRIUM_ENROLLMENT and capped at a flat
  // 4, so a shock could not change the roster by enough to show. With the target
  // deleted the book responds, and GL's Y3-Y5 moved — correctly.
  //
  // WC's arm already had the right form ("gross may move ONLY where the book
  // moved") because WC's report lag was removed earlier and someone had to think

      // required the worst tail year to be under 5% of the shock-year move —
      // a threshold calibrated on a branch where the tail happened to be 0.83%.
