// THE CLAIMS WORKBOOK, BUILT AND READ BACK.
//
// ⚠ NEITHER STANDING GATE WATCHES THIS FILE. value-identity-check keys on
// RESULT_METRICS field names and solo-export-guard hashes the SUMMARY export's
// cells; the claims workbook is in neither scope. A green run of both proves
// nothing about this sheet, and quoting them as evidence would be exactly the
// SCOPE blindness WORKING_PRACTICES records. So this script builds the real
// workbook through buildClaimsWorkbook, writes it, parses it back with the same
// library, and asserts against the cells that come out.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
//   SHAPE          the Occurrences sheet is gone; the sheets that remain are the
//                  active lines plus Development.
//   ROW IDENTITY   Booked + sum(Yr columns) === Current, and Total Development
//                  === Current - Booked, on every developed row, read from the
//                  PARSED cells rather than from the objects that built them.
//   THREE STATES   a blank development block, a blank Yr cell and a printed
//                  figure are three distinct things and all three occur.
//   MARKDOWN       Gross Incurred === Drawn Occurrence always (one claim per
//                  occurrence today), and Drawn > Booked under SQUEEZED funding
//                  while Drawn === Booked at DEFAULTS. That is the check the
//                  brief asked for and it cannot be run at defaults.
//   ONE LOOKUP     every developed occurrence on a line sheet appears on the
//                  Development sheet with the same figures.
//   GEOMETRY       column count and the per-claim series length, so the "does it
//                  need capping at year 20" question is answered with a number.
//   PRE-GAME       accident years -2, -1 and 0 have claim rows on every line
//                  sheet, and the line sheets and Development sheet agree on
//                  which accident years exist.
//   RELOAD         a game whose earlier claim detail was stripped from the save
//                  comes back WHOLE through claimRegeneration — same accident
//                  years and row counts as straight through, and no warning —
//                  and a game with no pre-game years does not warn either.
//   OPEN AND PAID  no row marked `open` has paid its whole Gross Incurred, and
//                  the headroom quantiles on open rows are printed beside it.
//                  This is the ONLY gate on the Gross Paid column — see the note
//                  at the check itself for what it can and cannot catch.
