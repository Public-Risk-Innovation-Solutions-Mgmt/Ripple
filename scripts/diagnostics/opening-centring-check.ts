// ============================================================================
// THE SEARCH STARTS WHERE THE BAND IS — A GATE.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/opening-centring-check.ts
//
// STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM is calibrated so each line's UNFILTERED candidate
// distribution centres on its own band's midpoint. That is not a property of the
// constant — it is a property of the constant AGAINST AN ENGINE, and every
// change to how a pre-game year accumulates surplus moves it. Payout patterns,
// closure curves and the per-claim payment split have all moved it since it was
// last set.
//
// ⚠ IT HAS NOW DRIFTED TWICE AND BOTH TIMES IT WAS FOUND BY ACCIDENT. Once at
// 995f6f9 (28.7% off, found while re-reading the constant) and once here (WC
// +0.19, Property +0.29, found while measuring something else entirely — the
// cost of a deeper pre-game). A third time is the expected outcome of fixing it
// and stopping, so this file exists to make the NEXT payout pattern trip a gate
// instead of the drift being noticed a month later.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THE DRIFT COSTS — AND THE OBVIOUS ANSWER IS WRONG, MEASURED.
//
// The natural claim, and the one this file was written believing: when the
// candidate distribution sits above the band, the ceiling rejects its top and
// the accepted set is drawn from the low tail, so the pool ships systematically
// weaker openings. THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS. At the drift this file was written
// for — the unfiltered median +34% of band width on WC, +29% on Property — the
// ACCEPTED median sat +5% and -3% off its midpoint, and on WC in the HIGH
// direction. Re-centring moved the accepted median by 2% of band width.
//
// The reason is that the band is narrow against the spread of the candidate
// distribution, so conditional on landing inside it the position within it is
// nearly uniform: the accepted p10-p90 spans 79-81% of the band both before and
// after re-centring. Selection cannot bias what it barely filters.
//
// WHAT DRIFT ACTUALLY COSTS IS ACCEPTANCE, and it is nonlinear. While the band
// still sits in the bulk, attempts barely move — measured 2.81 / 2.63 / 4.13
// before against 2.75 / 2.88 / 4.14 after, i.e. nothing. Once the band leaves
// the bulk the cost explodes: pin-vs-band-check doubles the pin and reads 16.6x
// and 12.7x on attempts, and at the retired pins the same perturbation reached
// 67.9 attempts with a worst case of 481 against a cap of 500. The failure mode
// is a cliff, not a slope.
//
// SO THIS GATE IS PREVENTIVE, AND HONEST ABOUT THAT. The drift it was written
// for had done no measurable damage yet. What it had done is move the search
// toward the edge of its own proposal distribution, where the next engine change
// of the same size would start pushing acceptance off the cliff. Watching
// attempts would give no warning until it was already expensive; watching the
// centring gives warning while it is still free.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ MEASURED UNFILTERED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE METHOD.
//
// UNFILTERED = attempt 0 of the real search, with no rejection. Measuring the
// median on the band-SELECTED sample is a fixed-point iteration against your own
// selection effect: the selected sample is confined to the band by construction,
// so it always looks well centred no matter how far the underlying distribution
// has drifted. 995f6f9 measured it both ways — GL read 1.119 selected against
// 0.900 unfiltered, and calibrating on the selected figure produced a band 48%
// above the old one. A gate that measured the selected sample would pass
// forever and assert nothing.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE TOLERANCE, AND WHY THIS NUMBER — IT IS SET ABOVE THE ESTIMATOR'S OWN NOISE.
//
// TOL = 0.25 x the band's own WIDTH, per line — not an absolute ratio. The bands
// differ in width (WC 0.39, GL 0.58, Property 0.57) and an absolute tolerance
// would be three different standards wearing one number.
//
// The number has to clear two things at once, and the first draft of this file
// only cleared one. THE EFFECT: the drift this was written for ran +0.19 on WC
// and +0.29 on Property, 49% and 52% of their band widths — so any tolerance
// under ~40% catches it. THE NOISE: the thing being tested is a MEDIAN of a wide
// distribution, and it has real sampling error.
//
// ⚠ THE NOISE HALF OF THAT WAS ARITHMETICALLY WRONG AND THE GATE HAS BEEN
// FLAPPING BECAUSE OF IT. This paragraph read: "Bootstrap SE at 800 seeds is
// 0.015 / 0.031 / 0.046 per line, so at this file's 400 it is about 0.021 /
// 0.044 / 0.065 — which is 5% / 8% / 11% of the respective band widths ... 25%
// is 2.3-4.8 SE". It then listed the band widths as "WC 0.39, GL 0.58, Property
// 0.57". THOSE ARE THE BANDS' UPPER BOUNDS, NOT THEIR WIDTHS. WC's band is
// [0.2667, 0.3921], width 0.1254 — not 0.39. Property's figure coincided only
// because its lower bound is 1.13, which is why the error survived.
//
// On the real widths, and using the SE this file PRINTS rather than an
// extrapolated bootstrap, at 400 seeds:
//
//     line       SE     band width   SE/width   25% tolerance in SE
//     WC       0.020      0.1254       16%            1.57
//     GL       0.024      0.1928       12%            2.01
//     Property 0.035      0.5700        6%            4.07
//
// So the tolerance was 1.6-4.1 SE, not 2.3-4.8, and WC's 1.57 SE is inside the
// range this file itself calls "would flap on noise alone". It duly flapped: WC
// went red at +0.034, 1.7 SE, and three independent measurements of the SAME
// quantity at the SAME shipped pin read -0.0130 (600 seeds), +0.0336 (400) and
// -0.0056 (2,400). The last is the true value and the pin was never off.
//
// ⚠ THE FIX IS THE SAMPLE, NOT THE TOLERANCE, AND NOT THE PIN. The rule at the
// foot of this block says a red means re-solve K rather than widen the
// threshold. Both of those are wrong for a 1.7 SE reading: re-solving on it
// chases noise, and it produced a 16% disagreement between two seed families
// (0.2949 against 0.3417) when tried. SEEDS goes to 1,600, which is 4x and puts
// WC at 3.14 SE, GL at 4.02 and Property at 8.1 — every line past 3 SE, where a
// red means something. Cost is ~57s -> ~230s in the sweep.
//
// Raising SEEDS tightens the SE as 1/sqrt(n) if a future reader wants a tighter
// gate; lowering it does the opposite and the tolerance must follow.
//
// ⚠ THE GATE IS THE POINT, THE THRESHOLD IS NOT. If a future engine change trips
// this at 0.26, the answer is to re-solve K — STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM's
// header records the method, the affine fit and the Newton step — not to widen
// the tolerance. Loosening this to make it pass would restore exactly the
// silence it exists to break.
