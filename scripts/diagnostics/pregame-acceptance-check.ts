// ============================================================================
// PRE-GAME ACCEPTANCE — THE BLOCKER. A GATE.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/pregame-acceptance-check.ts
//   SEEDS=400 npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/pregame-acceptance-check.ts
//
// This is a BLOCKER, not a calibration. runLinePreGame is a reject-and-redraw
// search: it simulates a candidate 3-year past on (seed + attempt x 997) and
// keeps redrawing until the ending surplus/premium lands inside
// OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND, giving up after MAX_HISTORY_ATTEMPTS = 500
// and shipping the closest miss. IF THE SEARCH STARTS FAILING, NO GAME
// GENERATES and everything downstream of the flip is moot — which is why this
// sits in Stage 1 rather than in the cascade.
//
// ⚠ WC IS THE FRAGILE LINE. Its band is the narrowest relative to its candidate
// spread (0.39 wide against WC's own opening distribution), and pin-vs-band's
// perturbation arm has already driven it to 67.9 mean attempts with a worst case
// of 481 against the 500 cap. WC is where a widened pre-game distribution runs
// out of room first.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS COULD NOT BE MEASURED UNTIL THE WIRING.
//
// The pre-game search calls processYear, which develops cohorts through
// processIbner. Until 05ea559 the per-claim revision law had no caller in src/,
// so processIbner always took the cohort path and "acceptance on the new path"
// was not a thing that existed to measure. It exists now, behind
// PER_CLAIM_REVISION.enabled, which is why that flag is a mutable holder rather
// than a bare boolean — see its note.
//
// ⚠ THIS GATE MUTATES THE FLAG AND PUTS IT BACK, in a finally, and asserts the
// restore. Nothing in src/ ever writes to it; the only other writer in the repo
// is revision-total-sd-report, which follows the same pattern. If a future
// reader finds the flag true after a failed run, those two are what to look at.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT IS ASSERTED: THE ARM THE FLAG SAYS IS LIVE, READ AND NOT HARDCODED.
//
// The block that stood here said "THE FLAG IS OFF AND NOTHING SHIPS ON THE ON
// ARM" and was left standing through the flip that made it false, sitting
// directly above a bounds note that contradicted it. Both are replaced by this.
//
// `LIVE` below is chosen by PER_CLAIM_REVISION.enabled, so the assertion follows
// the flag automatically and the inversion a flip creates cannot happen again —
// which is what the bounds note was reaching for when it asserted BOTH arms.
// The other arm is REPORTED in full beside it, and its numbers are the cost to
// name rather than a red light.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS A REDUCTION IN COVERAGE AND IT IS DELIBERATE. Asserting both arms
// was affordable while both sat near their bands. It stopped being affordable at
// the maturation-book commit, and the reason is structural rather than a
// regression: THE PIN IS ONE SCALAR PER LINE. It centres ONE candidate
// distribution. PER_CLAIM_REVISION off is a different development law, so over
// ten accident years it books a different reserve and its opening lands
// somewhere else — measured, the retired arm's median opening is 1.454 on WC and
// 2.390 on GL against bands topping out at 1.22 and 1.80. No single K centres
// two mechanisms, and asking this gate to require it is asking the pin to do
// something a scalar cannot do.
//
// ⚠ AND THE EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS NOT A GREEN-WASHED RED. The live arm did not
// squeak through, it improved: 2.23 / 2.27 / 3.27 mean attempts against 2.42 /
// 3.07 / 4.42 before the change, zero fallbacks on every line, and a WC median
// opening of 1.021 against a band midpoint of 1.025. opening-centring-check
// (1.3 / 1.6 / 0.2 SE off centre) and pin-vs-band-check both pass on the same
// commit. The bounds below were NOT touched.
//
// WHAT WOULD MAKE THE RETIRED ARM ASSERTABLE AGAIN: its own pin. That is a
// second calibration for a law nobody runs, kept only for null tests, and it is
// not worth a constant.
