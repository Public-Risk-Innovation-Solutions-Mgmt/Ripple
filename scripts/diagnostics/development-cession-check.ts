// ============================================================================
// CLAIM-LEVEL DEVELOPMENT CESSION — the mechanism's own guard.
//
// ⚠ THE NULL TEST IS THE MECHANISM SWITCH, NOT A LINE CONTROL. Every value in
// the model moves when this mechanism is on, so a same-tree line-by-line
// comparison has nothing to compare against.
//
// ⚠ AND SINCE THE SELECTION WENT SIZE-WEIGHTED IT IS NOT A COMPARISON AGAINST A
// STORED BASELINE EITHER. buildTrackedSet now spends an RNG draw per developing
// which reseeds every later draw in the `ibner` stream, so the mechanism-ON tree
// cannot be compared to ANY earlier capture — not the pre-mechanism parent, not
// the previous baseline. What survives is that the mechanism-OFF path does not
// call buildTrackedSet at all and therefore spends no draw. So the test becomes a
// BEFORE-AND-AFTER OF THE OFF PATH, taken across the change:
//
//   # on the parent commit
//   sed -i 's/ENABLED = true/ENABLED = false/' src/utils/developmentAllocation.ts
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/value-identity-check.ts --write   # to a scratch copy
//   git checkout baselines/ && sed -i 's/ENABLED = false/ENABLED = true/' src/utils/developmentAllocation.ts
//   # repeat on the child commit, then diff the two captures field by field
//
// Zero differing fields means nothing outside the mechanism moved. Run at the
// symmetric-routing commit: 28,500 fields, 0 added, 0 removed, 0 differing.
//
// ⚠ AND THE RESELECTION COMMIT SHOWED THE CAVEAT ABOVE IS ABOUT THE ROUTING OF
// THE DRAWS, NOT ABOUT SELECTION CHANGES AS SUCH. Reselection draws
// size-weighted every valuation, which would have reseeded `ibner` many times
// over — so it was given its own streams, keyed per (seed, valuation year, line,
// accident year, purpose), and `ibner` still takes exactly its ten developing-set picks
// at inception in the same order. That buys back a CONTROL STRONGER THAN THE
// MECHANISM SWITCH: stub the closure predicate to `() => false` and reselection
// becomes a no-op that spends no draw, so the mechanism-ON tree must reproduce
// the parent bit for bit. Measured: 29,400 fields, 0 added, 0 removed, 0
// differing, against 11,748 changed with closure live. A future selection change
// that keeps its draws off `ibner` gets the same control; one that does not has
// only the off-path before-and-after.
//
// THIS SCRIPT ASSERTS THE INVARIANTS THAT HOLD WITH THE MECHANISM ON:
//
//   CONSERVATION      allocated deltas sum EXACTLY to the movement being
//                     allocated, and ceded + retained equals it exactly. A
//                     register that disagrees with the exhibit by a cent is the
//                     memberList defect in a new place.
//   NON-NEGATIVITY    a developed occurrence never goes below zero. Favourable
//                     development on a small claim is the same shape as the
//                     reserve floor, and the fix there was to develop the
//                     remaining balance.
//   ROLLFORWARD       ending = beginning + booked - development - paid still
//                     holds exactly, with development now net of cession.
//   CESSION SANITY    ceded never exceeds the movement; a cohort with no
//                     register cedes exactly zero; cession only ever arises on
//                     occurrences above the retention.
//   MARTINGALE        E[ultimate] is unchanged by the mechanism on the GROSS
//                     side — cession moves who pays, not what the loss is.

// The no-tower arm still cedes on PRE-GAME accident years, which bought cover.
// What it must not do is cede on a year that declined every layer, asserted
// per-cohort above.
// ⚠ THE OLD ASSERTION HERE — "squeezed must cede MORE than defaults" — WAS
// WRITTEN FOR THE DEFECT AND IS NOW EXACTLY BACKWARDS. Squeezed ceding more was
// the perverse incentive: underfunding bought cover. Total cession is supposed
// to be path-independent, and the arm comparison that tests it needs PAIRED
// seeds, so it lives in cession-path-independence.ts, which is now a gate.
// Nothing about a one-armed dollar total can stand in for it.
// ⚠ THIS THRESHOLD REPLACED "EXACTLY ZERO IS A BUG", and the reason is the
// symmetric-routing commit. Under the retired rule favourable development went
// proportionally across the whole register, so an occurrence could only reach
// zero if the entire register did — it never happened, and zero was the right
// bar. Symmetric routing sends favourable movements to the same ten developing claims
// adverse uses, and a give-back larger than those ten hold takes them to zero by
// construction; it is what SYMMETRY MEANS at the boundary, since adverse has no
// matching bound. So the bar is now the HARM rather than the event: an
// occurrence sitting at zero costs nothing unless it climbs back over the
// retention, where the dollars it already ceded would be retained a second time.
