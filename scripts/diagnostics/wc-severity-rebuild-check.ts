// Run: npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/wc-severity-rebuild-check.ts
//
// REPLACES wc-claim-check.ts and wc-derived-figures-check.ts, both of which
// verified the retired four-tier structure end to end (tier probabilities,
// per-tier severities, the catastrophic annuity's present-value booking, the
// three-way payout decomposition, the presumption process). None of those
// quantities exist any more, so the harnesses were deleted rather than
// half-ported — a check that still compiles against a model it no longer
// describes is worse than no check.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS ASSERTED AND WHAT IS ONLY REPORTED — read this before adding a gate.
//
// The blended CV is 11.22 to 14.56 by group and the heavy component's is 7.32,
// so a SAMPLE MEAN of WC loss is dominated by the largest draw seen and does not
// concentrate at any usable rate. Everything dollar-weighted is therefore
// ASSERTED ANALYTICALLY and REPORTED from the draw with a bootstrap interval.
// Counts have bounded per-observation variance, so they can be gated directly.
// Gating a realized dollar mean against a fixed percentage is the failure mode
// this project has hit four times; it is finding 26's standing rule.
