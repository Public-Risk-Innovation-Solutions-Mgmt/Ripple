// ============================================================================
// DOES SQUEEZED FUNDING BUY REINSURANCE RECOVERY? — A GATE, NOT A MEASUREMENT.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS ASSERTS IS THE INCEPTION COMPONENT, AND IT ASSERTS IT AS AN
// EQUIVALENCE TEST. Not the total, and not "the interval contains zero" — see
// THE GATE section below for both reasons. It began as
// a measurement and found that squeezed recovered $27.47M more on WC, 95% CI
// [$21.20M, $33.74M], with all three lines diverging the same way — underfunding
// bought cover. The fix is the claim-level markdown plus the inception
// give-back; this is the assertion that it stayed fixed.
//
// It is the ONLY test that can see this. A single-arm dollar total cannot: the
// quantity is a DIFFERENCE between two arms on the same seeds, and the guard in
// development-cession-check.ts runs its arms on different seeds by construction.
//
// THE ARITHMETIC THAT SHOULD HOLD. Cession on an occurrence is f(value), and
// the increment booked each year telescopes:
//
//     total = f(initial) + [f(final) - f(initial)] = f(final)
//
// f(final) is path-independent, so squeezing should MOVE cession between
// "recognised at inception" and "recognised on development" without changing
// the sum. If the total moves, underfunding buys cover.
//
// THE ASSUMPTION THAT MAKES IT HOLD is that both arms drive the claims to the
// SAME f(final). That requires the booking bias to reach the claim values. It
// does not — see the coherence section below — so this is measured rather than
// asserted.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THIS GATE IS RED, AND THE BISECT SAYS SOMETHING OTHER THAN "COMMIT X BROKE
// IT". Read this before trying to fix it. Findings recorded at 8402b33; the gate
// itself has not changed since 932246f, so everything below is a pure engine
// comparison against a fixed instrument.
//
// THE BISECT LANDS ON 995fd6f ("Re-translate GL's opening band, re-centre the
// pre-game pins"), AND THAT IS A POWER BOUNDARY, NOT A MECHANISM BOUNDARY. That
// commit re-centred the opening pins, which cut the mean pre-game redraws from
// 7.25 to 1.63 on WC. Fewer redraws is a tighter opening distribution, which is
// a smaller between-game variance, which is a narrower interval — and the
// interval stopped straddling zero. Nothing about cession changed there.
//
// At GAMES=200 the "last good" parent and the current tip are statistically
// indistinguishable:
//
//   accdadb (green at 60)   WC total  -$2.04M  [-$4.24M, +$0.16M]
//   8402b33 (red at 60)     WC total  -$2.21M  [-$4.13M, -$0.29M]
//
// One misses zero by $0.16M and the other by $0.29M. The gate's own default of
// GAMES=60 cannot resolve the effect it is testing; it has been passing on noise
// and failing on slightly less noise.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS NOT WC-ONLY. That is an artefact of which line's two components
// happen to cancel. Split by recognition point at GAMES=200, the DEVELOPMENT
// component excludes zero on ALL THREE LINES and has been stable across the
// whole range, while the inception component is centred on zero everywhere:
//
//   line       inception diff (200 games)   development diff (200 games)
//   WC          +$0.02M [-1.92, +1.95]       -$2.23M [-2.46, -1.99]
//   GL          +$0.72M [-1.87, +3.31]       -$3.50M [-3.76, -3.24]
//   Property    +$0.23M [-2.48, +2.93]       -$1.12M [-1.31, -0.94]
//
// GL's is the LARGEST. WC is simply the line whose total crosses first, because
// GL's positive inception noise offsets more of its development gap. The
// development figures at accdadb are -2.23 / -3.46 / -1.27 — the same numbers.
// This has been present continuously, on every line, for the whole range.
//
// ⚠ THE MECHANISM IS THE BOOKING BIAS, AND IT IS LINEAR IN IT. Measured by
// moving IBNER_BOOKING_BIAS_COEFF and re-running at GAMES=200:
//
//   coeff    WC dev diff   GL dev diff   Property dev diff
//   0.00       -$0.05M       -$0.15M         -$0.01M      all contain zero
//   0.40       -$1.13M       -$1.82M         -$0.58M
//   0.80       -$2.23M       -$3.50M         -$1.12M      (the shipped value)
//
// Straight through the origin, 50.7% / 52.0% / 51.8% at half strength. With the
// bias at zero the development gap vanishes on all three lines and every total
// contains zero — the entire failure flows through the bias and through nothing
// else. Not membership divergence between the arms, not the tower, not anything
// WC-specific.
//
// ⚠ WHICH IS THE TIME MISMATCH developmentAllocation.ts ALREADY NAMES, resolving
// at a sample size that file did not reach. Its header records: "The markdown
// and the unwind are both proportional but applied at DIFFERENT TIMES ... so the
// shares the unwind restores are not the shares the markdown took, and the tower
// is convex", measured at 50 games as having shrunk to "-0.6% CI [-2.2%, 1.0%],
// contains zero" and believed closed. It had not closed; 50 games could not see
// it. The give-back closes the DETERMINISTIC band exactly — that is the
// telescoping in markDownForBooking's header, and it holds. What no give-back
// can close is the interaction between the marked-down level and the STOCHASTIC
// steps: under squeeze the claims spend the runoff climbing back from a lower
// base, so the same lognormal wobble happens at lower occurrence values and
// cedes less through a convex tower.
//
// ⚠ AND THE DIRECTION IS THE INVERSE OF THE DEFECT THIS GATE WAS BUILT FOR.
// The original finding was squeezed recovering $27.47M MORE — underfunding
// buying cover. Every reading here is squeezed recovering LESS. The perverse
// incentive is dead; what is left is a smaller residual pointing the other way,
// which penalises underfunding rather than rewarding it. That is a reason to
// rank it below the original, not a reason to call it harmless.
//
// ⚠ ALL THREE WERE RULED ON AT THE NEXT COMMIT, and this file now implements the
// ruling rather than describing the choice:
//
//   GAMES rose from 60 to 300, where every line resolves the tolerance it is
//     asserted against. See the constant.
//   the development residual is REPORTED, not gated — it is inherent, and the
//     alternative is the original defect. See the block above that section.
//   the stochastic step still applies to the marked-down register. Changing that
//     is the only thing that would REMOVE the residual rather than tolerate it,
//     and it was not taken: the residual is an order of magnitude smaller than
//     the defect it replaced and signed the other way.
// ============================================================================
//
// PAIRED, SAME SEEDS. The two arms differ only in the funding decision, so the
// difference is taken per (game, line) and the interval is on the DIFFERENCE.
// Two means side by side would be swamped by between-game variance.

// cannot see, so this number failing is visible rather than silent.
//
// 70s keeps it inside the fast tier: the tier's wall clock is ~119s at 3-way
// concurrency and its previous longest job was 45s, so this becomes the longest
// job without becoming the binding constraint.
// ⚠ 300 -> 600 AT IBNER_CALENDAR_RHO, AND IT IS THE SAME THINNING THAT COST
// maturity-anchor-check ITS SAMPLE IN THE SAME COMMIT. This gate's statistic is
// a DIFFERENCE between two arms, and its resolution is set by the between-game
// variance of that difference. The calendar blend widens WC's reserve, which
// widens exactly that variance, so the estimator got noisier while the bound
// stayed where it was.
//
// MEASURED, WC inception diff against a ~$0.35M tolerance:
//
//   commit                    GAMES   diff      95% CI            verdict
//   eaf930a (before)            300   -$0.01M   [-0.35, +0.34]    ok

//   IBNER_CALENDAR_RHO          600   +$0.26M   [-0.04, +0.56]    ok
//
// The flip at 300 is about ONE standard error of the difference, and both
// failing and passing intervals contain zero — which is this file's own
// recorded pathology from the other direction ("passing on noise and failing
// on slightly less noise", $0.16M against $0.29M). At 600 the interval tightens
// and the reading is inside the bound.
//
// ⚠ AND THE MECHANISM ARGUMENT SAYS THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING HERE, which is why
// the sample and not the bound is what moved. The calendar shock is a pure
// function of (gameId, line, valuationYear), so it is IDENTICAL in the defaults
// and squeezed arms; a common term largely cancels in a difference between
// them. The only route to the inception component is indirect — wider reserve,
// noisier triangle, different rate, different membership, different register —
// and that re-rolls both arms rather than biasing their gap.
//
// ⚠ DO NOT PUT THIS BACK TO 300 TO SAVE THE RUNTIME, and do not widen the
// tolerance instead. The tolerance is derived per line from the arms' own
// spread; loosening it to fit a sample that cannot see is the failure this
// directory keeps finding. Measured 785s against 458s, and it is by a wide
// margin the longest job in the fast tier.

// ============================================================================
// REPORTED, NOT ASSERTED — THE DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT.
//
// ⚠ THE MECHANISM IS UNRESOLVED. THE EXPLANATION THAT STOOD HERE WAS WRONG AND
// IS KEPT BECAUSE IT IS A TRAP WORTH MARKING.
//
// IT SAID: "the register is marked down at inception, so under squeeze the claims
// spend the runoff climbing back from a lower base. The same lognormal wobble
// therefore lands at lower occurrence values, and cession is convex, so it cedes
// less." That cannot be the mechanism, and the reason is one line of arithmetic.
//
// ⚠ CESSION IS BOOKED AS INCREMENTS, SO IT TELESCOPES. cedeDevelopment computes
// cedeToLayer(next) - cedeToLayer(current) at each step and sums, so over a
// claim's whole life the development total is cede(final) - cede(start), and
// EVERY INTERMEDIATE VALUE CANCELS. The path cannot matter. The wobble cannot
// matter. Convexity cannot matter — it is evaluated only at the two endpoints.
//
// And the endpoints are handled. This gate puts bookingGiveBack in the
// DEVELOPMENT bucket (see the Tally), so:
//
//   squeezed    [cede(marked) - cede(drawn)] + [cede(final) - cede(marked)]
//   defaults                                   [cede(final) - cede(drawn)]
//
// which are the same expression. The give-back is exactly the term that makes
// the marked-down start cancel. A persistent difference therefore means the
// telescoping is BROKEN, or the two arms do not reach the same cede(final) —
// not that convexity leaked in along the way.
//
// ⚠ MEASURED, AND IT IS NONE OF THE THREE OBVIOUS CANDIDATES. It is the
// MEASUREMENT WINDOW. The development component is not reporting a property of
// the engine at all.
//
//   THE GIVE-BACK IS RECOGNISED IN FULL AT INCEPTION. The unwind that earns it
//   back is spread over the cohort's HORIZON — up to 12 years on WC. A cohort
//   written in the last H years of the window is cut mid-unwind: its give-back
//   is inside the sum and the recovery that offsets it is not. Every window has
//   a fixed tail of such cohorts, so the gap is a constant number of
//   cohort-equivalents rather than a rate.
//
// THE EVIDENCE IS THE SCALING. Run the same gate over longer windows and the
// gap grows in DOLLARS while shrinking as a SHARE, with the product almost
// exactly constant — which is what a fixed-size tail against a linearly growing
// total looks like, and what no engine mechanism would look like:

//   window    WC dev diff   as % of total   product      GL %    product
//   12 yrs      -$2.11M         -4.3%         51.6       -2.3%     27.6
//   25 yrs      -$3.05M         -2.2%         55.0       -1.2%     30.0
//   40 yrs      -$4.22M         -1.3%         52.0       -0.8%     32.0
//
// (The dollars grow because later cohorts are larger — wage and severity trend
// — not because more is going wrong.)
//
// AND THE CORROBORATION IS ALREADY IN THE REPOSITORY. cession-uplift-basis
// measures the same quantity OVER COMPLETE COHORT LIVES rather than over a
// window, and it contains zero and has throughout. Two instruments, one
// windowed and one not, disagreeing exactly as truncation predicts.
//
// ⚠ THE THREE CANDIDATES, ALL RULED OUT BY MEASUREMENT. Recorded because each
// was plausible and ruling them out is most of the work:
//
//   1. THE CLAIM STOPS MID-PATH ON CLOSURE. Ruled out. Forcing the closure
//      predicate to `() => false` so no claim ever closes leaves the gap where
//      it was: WC -$2.17M against -$2.23M, GL -$3.46M against -$3.50M, Property
//      -$1.12M against -$1.12M. Claims stopping is not what stops the sum; the
//      window is.
//
//   2. THE TRACKED SET DEPENDS ON THE MARKED-DOWN VALUE. Ruled out twice, by
//      construction and by measurement. buildTrackedSet is called on the DRAWN
//      totals BEFORE markDownForBooking, so `totals[i] >= retention` never sees
//      a booked value and a claim's tower position does not depend on how
//      optimistically it was reserved. Measured over 25 paired games: of 126,950
//      WC claims written in BOTH arms' registers, 1,043 are tracked at defaults
//      only and 1,054 under squeeze only — 0.8%, and SYMMETRIC. The markdown
//      mechanism would be one-sided.
//
//   3. THE CLAMP AND SPILL FIRE SOONER. Ruled out. Zero occurrences driven to
//      exactly zero, in either arm, on all three lines, at GAMES=300 — see THE
//      CLAMP section at the end of this report, which prints it every run.
//
// ⚠ AND A FOURTH, MINE, ALSO WRONG, kept because it is the more tempting version
// of the convexity error. The markdown and the unwind are both proportional over
// tracked-plus-untracked but applied at different times, so the tracked share
// drifts in between and the tracked claims might not recover what they lost.
// Testable: make the stochastic step proportional too, and the drift goes away.
// It does not. The shortfall survives at -1.59% / -0.61% / -1.28% against
// -1.79% / -0.59% / -1.18%. Subset routing is not the route.
//
// ⚠ DO NOT RE-ASSERT THE CONVEXITY STORY WITHOUT ANSWERING THE TELESCOPING
// ARGUMENT FIRST. It is intuitive, it sounds like the header of
// developmentAllocation.ts, and it is the reason this went unexamined for four
// commits. The same argument disposes of any explanation phrased as "the path
// differs": cession is booked as increments, so only the endpoints survive.
//
// ⚠ WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY CLOSE IT: measure development cession over COMPLETE
// COHORT LIVES rather than over a fixed window, which is what
// cession-uplift-basis does. Not done here because that is a different
// instrument, this one is paired across arms and that one is not, and the
// component is reported rather than gated — a reported number that is honest
// about being window-truncated is better than a second measurement engine.
//
// ⚠ THE "ACCEPT IT" RULING STANDS, FOR A DIFFERENT REASON THAN IT WAS MADE FOR.
// It was made on the belief that the gap was an inherent property of the
// markdown. It is not a property of the engine at all — there is nothing in the
// engine to accept or fix. What is being accepted is that a windowed measurement
// of a quantity with a multi-year tail carries a truncation term, which is a
// property of the instrument and is now labelled as one.
//
// The conditional attached to that ruling — "if it is mostly candidate 2, select
// the tracked set on the DRAWN value and the ruling is withdrawn" — does not
// fire. The tracked set is ALREADY selected on the drawn value.
//
// ⚠ THE ALTERNATIVE IS STILL THE ORIGINAL DEFECT, and that argument is unchanged
// by the re-diagnosis. Not marking the claims down is what let the unwind
// inflate them PAST their drawn value, and squeezed pools then EXTRACTED
// recovery: $27.47M more on WC, 95% CI [$21.20M, $33.74M]. That was an engine
// property. This is a measurement tail, an order of magnitude smaller and signed
// the other way.
//
// ⚠ THE LINEARITY TABLE IS HERE SO A FUTURE READER CAN TELL A CHANGE IN
// MAGNITUDE FROM A CHANGE IN KIND. Measured at GAMES=200 by moving
// IBNER_BOOKING_BIAS_COEFF and re-running:
//
//   coeff    WC dev diff   GL dev diff   Property dev diff
//   0.00       -$0.05M       -$0.15M         -$0.01M      all contain zero
//   0.40       -$1.13M       -$1.82M         -$0.58M
//   0.80       -$2.23M       -$3.50M         -$1.12M      the shipped value
//
// Straight through the origin: 50.7% / 52.0% / 51.8% at half strength. If a
// future reading is off this line, something has changed in KIND and the
// mechanism above no longer describes it. If it is on the line at a different
// coefficient, only the bias moved.
