// It collects `problems[]` and prints `FAIL` beside every failing row, then
// used to end on a console.log and exit 0 — so `npm run gates` printed `ok`
// beside a script that had just printed FAIL. That is worse than a probe which
// asserts nothing: the runner actively reports green, and only someone reading
// the body would learn otherwise. Ruled at 153980b's audit: promote, do not
// rename. The assertions are real and were built and used as gates.
//
// The verdict names what failed, per 8402b33's rule, and the count is printed
// even when the list is truncated so a reader knows there is more.
