// ============================================================================
// THE CLOSURE DRAW — A GATE.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXITS NON-ZERO. Run:
//   npx tsx scripts/diagnostics/closure-draw-check.ts
//
// A claim's status is `closedShare(curve, t) >= unit(gameId, claimId)`. If the
// unit is uniform on [0,1) then the realised closure share MUST equal the
// curve's own expectation. Everything here asserts that, and the two ways it
// silently failed.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
//
//   UNIFORM, PER LINE      the unit's mean is 0.5 and its deciles are flat, on
//                          EACH LINE SEPARATELY. This is the one that matters,
//                          and per-line is the whole point: the shipped hash was
//                          plain FNV-1a returning the TOP 24 bits, which is
//                          clean on GL (mean 0.4994, ids fixed-shape ending
//                          `-c1`) and badly biased on WC (mean 0.4882,
//                          chi-squared(9) 258 against a 21.7 critical value,
//                          ids 23-32 chars ending in a variable-length component
//                          token). A pooled check would have read acceptable. A
//                          check written against GL first would have read clean.
//
//   CALIBRATED             realised closure equals the curve's expectation on
//                          the claims actually drawn, per line and per age. This
//                          is the consequence of uniformity and is asserted
//                          separately because it is the quantity that matters —
//                          the bias above moved WC's age-1 closure +1.75 points.
//
//   MONOTONE               a closed claim stays closed as age increases. Free
//                          given a fixed unit and a monotone curve, and asserted
//                          because a future change to either could break it
//                          without anything else noticing.
//
//   SEED-INDEPENDENT       two games with different identities give UNCORRELATED
//                          closure on the claim ids they share. Claim ids carry
//                          no seed — `wc-1-member-004-large-0` is the same string
//                          in every game, and 21.9% of WC ids collide between two
//                          unrelated games — so hashing the id ALONE gave the
//                          same closure to the same slot in every game, on
//                          entirely different claims. That is the defect
//                          enrolment-independence-check exists to prevent
//                          elsewhere, arriving through a display derivation.
//                          This is the arm that would catch its return.

 * ⚠ 14 AND NOT 6, AND IT RUNS IN THE SAME TIME. Each game pays for a ten-year
 * PRE-GAME before a single played year exists, so years amortise that cost and
 * games repeat it: 14 years costs 9s against the 6-year default's 8s and more
 * than doubles every arm's sample.
 *
 * MEASURED, and the reason is that two arms here were short of what their own
 * bounds need once the book froze at ~64 members:
 *
 *   THE MEAN ARM (MAX_MEAN_Z). n is CLAIMS, so it scales with the book. At the
 *   old default the frozen book gave WC 30,882 / GL 19,718 / Property 2,310
 *   against 42,410 / 26,532 / 3,094 with new business on — a 27% loss of sample
 *   and a 17% loss of power. At 14 years it reads 67,793 / 5,329 on WC and
 *   Property, which is MORE than the pre-freeze figure, so the minimum
 *   detectable bias goes 0.575% -> 0.388% on WC and 2.10% -> 1.38% on Property.
 *   Property matters most: the defect this arm exists to catch is a 2.36% bias,
 *   so its headroom goes from 1.12x to 1.7x.
 *
 *   THE CROSS-GAME ARM. GL had 391 shared ids against the 403 its own bound
 *   needs (see MIN_SHARED_FOR_R) and was being tested below its resolution. At
 *   14 years it has 909 and is tested properly.
 *
 * ⚠ PROPERTY STILL CANNOT BE TESTED BY THE CROSS-GAME ARM AT ANY REASONABLE
 * SAMPLE — 49 shared ids at 14 years against 403 needed, and closing that would
 * take roughly eight times the years. It is skipped WITH ITS RESOLUTION PRINTED
 * rather than silently omitted, which is the honest form of a line being out of
 * scope for an instrument.

// ⚠ A Z-SCORE, NOT AN ABSOLUTE DRIFT — AND THIS FILE MADE THE SAME MISTAKE
// TWICE, ONCE HERE AND ONCE AT MAX_CALIBRATION_Z BELOW. The bound was 0.005,
// picked as "far inside the measured defect (0.0118 on WC) and far outside float
// noise". That is one of two constraints and it only met the first. The mean of
// n uniform draws has SE = (1/sqrt(12))/sqrt(n), so an ABSOLUTE bound means a
// different thing on each line: 0.005 is 2.9 SE on WC's ~29,000 claims, 2.5 SE
// on GL's ~18,000, and **0.83 SE on Property's ~2,300**. A bound below one
// standard error cannot pass reliably, and Property's arm was a coin flip from
// the day it was written.
//
// MEASURED, on eight independent 10-game bases: Property fails the 0.005 bound
// on FOUR of the eight, at 0.78 / 0.87 / 1.40 / 1.71 / 1.81 sigma — noise every
// time. WC and GL never exceed 1.4 sigma on any base. It read green until the
// pre-game pin was re-centred at v34, which re-rolls every claim population and
// simply landed Property on a losing side (+0.0100, 1.65 sigma).
//
// SO THIS IS A UNITS FIX, NOT A LOOSENING. On WC the sigma bound is 0.0061
// against the old 0.0055 — materially the same standard — while on Property it
// stops asserting something the sample cannot support. The defect the gate was
// built to catch, WC's mean of 0.4882 on 27,745 claims, scores 6.8 sigma and
// still fails at nearly twice over.
//
// 3.5 sigma across three lines, matching MAX_CALIBRATION_Z for the same reason.

// hash produced — takes WC to -4.34 sigma and fails. Property reads 0.64 sigma
// on the same bias and passes, which is what 2,300 claims can support and is the
// same resolution limit the calibration block below already prints. The mean
// arm is a WC and GL instrument; Property is watched by the chi-squared and by
// the calibration block, and saying so beats a bound that pretends otherwise.

 * 20 shared ids that is 0.243 — nearly two and a half times the 0.10 bound being
 * applied to it, so the arm could only fire on noise. It did: at YEARS=14
 * Property crossed 20 with 49 shared ids, read r = -0.174, and FAILED at 1.18 SE
 * from zero. The bound had not caught anything; the sample had merely grown past
 * the skip.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THAT IS THE MIRROR OF THE SILENT FAILURE THIS GATE'S MEAN ARM CARRIES.
 * A z-bound with too few observations goes quietly GREEN; a fixed-magnitude
 * bound with too few observations goes randomly RED. Both are the same defect —
 * a threshold applied at a sample that cannot resolve it — and only the second
 * announces itself, which is why this one was found by raising the sample rather
 * than by the sweep.
 *
 * Requiring the bound to be at least 2 SE gives 1/sqrt(n-3) <= 0.10/2, so
