// ============================================================================
// A THROWAWAY STUB SERVER FOR THE FIVE ENDPOINTS. NOT A DEPLOYMENT.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS NOT THE SERVER. The real one is Lambda behind API Gateway with
// DynamoDB underneath, and nothing in this file survives that: no handler
// signature, no router, no storage, no lifecycle. What this file is for is
// running the HTTP transport against something real enough to be wrong —
// separate origins, real latency, real concurrency, real CORS — inside this
// container, today. It holds rooms in a Map and forgets them when it exits.
//
// ⚠ IT BORROWS THE RULES RATHER THAN RESTATING THEM, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
// The five endpoints' behaviour — who may advance, what a rejoin means, when a
// result is WRONG_YEAR, what `read` redacts — is written once, in
// LocalSessionTransport. A stub that re-implemented those rules would be a
// SECOND OPINION about the contract, and the first time the two disagreed the
// contract harness would be testing two different things while reporting one.
// So the stub runs that same class over an in-memory Storage shim and does
// nothing but move JSON.
//
// ⚠ AND THE REAL SERVER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THAT. It re-implements these
// rules in whatever runs on Lambda, against DynamoDB rather than a key-value
// blob — which is the moment the contract harness stops being a nicety and
// becomes the acceptance test for that implementation. It is written against
// the interface, so it can be pointed at the deployed URL unchanged.
//
// ⚠ LOCKING: FREE HERE, NOT FREE ON LAMBDA. Node runs one thread and this
// handler's whole read-modify-write is synchronous inside LocalSessionTransport
// (its latency await happens BEFORE the critical section), so two overlapping
// requests cannot interleave and no lock is needed. navigator.locks does not
// even exist here, and the transport's lock helper degrades to running the work
// directly — correct in this process, for the same reason it was correct in the
// Node harness. On Lambda that reasoning evaporates: concurrent invocations are
// genuinely parallel processes, so the read-modify-write MUST become a
// conditional write — DynamoDB `ConditionExpression` on the room's `rev`, retry
// on failure — or per-field atomic updates. `rev` is already in the record and
// already monotonic per write, which is exactly the token that condition needs.
// ⚠ SUPERSEDED: the design took per-item writes, each guarded on the field it
// depends on, and `rev` is NOT the write guard — guarding on it would make every
// concurrent write conflict. It stays the ETag. See src/session/server/keys.ts.
//
// Run: npx tsx scripts/tools/session-stub-server.ts --port 4100
