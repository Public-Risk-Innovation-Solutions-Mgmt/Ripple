// IT NEEDS A BUILT APP AND A SERVER, which is why there is no npm script: a
// bare `npm run render` that assumed a server would fail confusingly for anyone
// who had not started one. RENDER_URL points it elsewhere (default :4173) and
// RENDER_BASELINE points the comparison file elsewhere — together those are what
// let one commit be measured against another in a worktree, which is how the
// defect reproduction below was done.
//
// VALUE_IDENTITY answers "did any computed value move?" and SOLO_EXPORT_GUARD
// answers "did the export's shape move?". Neither can answer "did the SCREEN
// move?", because neither renders one. 27 of this repo's 86 src files — every
// page, every component, App.tsx — are reachable from no gate at all, and every
// display defect found in them this month was found by a person looking at a
// browser. This file is the instrument that looks.
//
// ⚠ IT IS NOT THE "SOLO ORACLE". That instrument is cited by name in five commit
// messages on claude/bold-bardeen-38lhp5 and exists in NO branch and NO commit of
// this repository — searched by content across all 25 remote branches and across
// the whole history for added-or-deleted files. It was run ad hoc, out of tree,
// and vanished with the sitting that produced it. This is a new instrument built
// to fill the same gap, and it deliberately differs in one way that matters: THE
// OLD ONE PLAYED WC-ONLY. Every Membership defect found this month lived in a
// configuration it never played — GL-only and Property-only opened with an empty
// roster, WC+GL opened showing 65 of 112 members — so its 46/46 proved
// CONFINEMENT and not correctness. This one plays five configurations.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE RECAPTURE RULE IS THE OTHER TWO BASELINES', VERBATIM. A MOVED
// FINGERPRINT IS A CHANGE TO INVESTIGATE, NOT A REASON TO RE-BASELINE.
//
// `--write` exists because legitimate display changes happen, exactly as they do
// for the other two. It is not the response to a red run. The response to a red
// run is to open the named screen and find out why it moved — the key is
// Config|Tab|LineView|Year precisely so the diff tells you which screen to open.
// Re-capture only once you can say what moved and why, and say it in the commit.
// A baseline re-captured to make a run green measures nothing afterwards.
// ============================================================================
//
// WHAT A FINGERPRINT IS. Key Config|Tab|LineView|Year; value a SHA-256 of the
// page's normalised visible text. Normalisation collapses whitespace so a reflow
// is not a diff while a number is — see NORMALISE below for everything that had
// to be neutralised and why.
//
// TWO YEAR-POINTS: `y0` before any year is locked, and `y2` after two processed
// years. y0 is not decoration — two of this month's three Membership defects
// lived ONLY there, because the page falls back to `initialMembers` until a
// result exists and that fallback was reading WC unconditionally.
//
// WHY scripts/tools/ AND NOT scripts/diagnostics/: everything in diagnostics is
// under gates.ts's manifest check, which fails on a file it does not know by
// name. This is a harness, not a gate — it needs a browser and a built app.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ IT REPRODUCES ALL THREE MEMBERSHIP DEFECTS, AND ONE OF THE THREE IS THE
// REASON TO TRUST IT. Measured by building each commit in a worktree, serving
// it, and comparing with RENDER_BASELINE:
//
//   DEFECT 1, the year-0 roster (76473f1^ -> 76473f1): 4 of 232 moved, and they
//   are EXACTLY GL|y0, PR|y0, WC+GL|y0 and WC+GL+PR|y0 on Membership. Exactly
//   the four configurations that commit names as broken, at exactly the
//   year-point that was wrong, with WC-ONLY UNCHANGED — which is the negative
//   that commit also asserts. Nothing at y2 moved, which is right: the fallback
//   only renders before a year is locked. This is the one that says the
//   instrument measures what it claims to.
//
//   DEFECT 2, the line view and the WC-hardcoded columns (76473f1 -> e7a3db6):
//   a KEY-SET change on all five configurations — Membership|- disappears and
//   Membership|Pool plus one key per active line appear — because the tab gained
//   the Pool/per-line bar.
//
//   DEFECT 3, roster and tiles following the view (e7a3db6 -> 741c240): 20 of
//   248 moved, every one on Membership, on the per-line views at both
//   year-points.
//
// ⚠ AND THE THREE CANNOT BE SEPARATED IF COMPARED TOGETHER. Run against the
// commit before all three (6115f33 -> 750ce12) it reports 36 moved, all on
// Membership, in all five configurations at both year-points — but every one is
// `absent -> hash` or `hash -> absent`, because defect 2's key-set change
// removes the unit defects 1 and 3 would have been measured in. The instrument
// says "Membership changed everywhere" and cannot say more. THAT IS A REAL LIMIT
// AND IT IS NOT FIXABLE BY NORMALISATION: when the set of screens changes, there
// is no before-value for the after-key to differ from. Attribution needs the
// commits taken one at a time, which is what the three runs above do.

// v2: THE FIRST RECAPTURE. v1 was taken at c28ec2c and carried 236 of 298 rows
// red across fourteen commits, because every commit in between reported its own
// movement and correctly declined to re-baseline. That is the rule working, but
// a baseline is only an instrument while somebody reads it: by the end each

//
// WHAT v2 ACCEPTS, attributed commit by commit by building each one and

// 2adc80d and 56efd06, 236 at 1d640c6. The record is verified.
//
// ⚠ AND THE 18 FROM THE SCALE WERE RULED ON BEFORE THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN,
// because a recapture accepts them silently otherwise. All 18 are at y2 and none
// at y0 — satisfaction is flat at its opening value until a year is played.
// Masking every two-decimal number makes all 18 rows BYTE-IDENTICAL, so nothing
// reordered, no label moved and no screen restructured. Of 2,354 two-decimal
// numbers on those rows 1,404 changed and 950 did not, every changed one inside
// the 1-10 satisfaction scale. Solving each for the anchor it implies under an
// exact 3x, A = (3*old - new)/2, puts all 1,404 inside [7.19, 7.23] — which is
// OPENING_SATISFACTION's [7.20, 7.22] widened only by 2dp rounding, mean 7.2056.
// It is the scale, and it is nothing else.
//
// ⚠ ONE THING FOUND WHILE RULING, PRE-EXISTING AND NOT ACCEPTED BY THIS FILE:
// there are TWO satisfaction numbers on screen. MembershipPage renders the
// four-limb member model at 2dp and moved; ResultsPage and DashboardPage render
// `result.memberSatisfaction`, a separate pool-level scalar, at 1dp and did not.
// 26 y2 rows mention satisfaction and did not move — Calculation Audit's are all
// static labels and weights, but Results shows a real value that the scale never
// reached. That predates v1 and is recorded here rather than fixed.
// ============================================================================
// RENDER_BASELINE overrides the file, which is what lets one build be compared
// against another (an A/B across two commits) rather than only against the

// uses.
//
// ⚠ v8 -> v9: THE FIVE-BAND LOSS-RATIO SCALE. Five rows moved, all of them
// Results|Pool|y2, one per configuration, and every one a prose-only change to
// the loss sentence — attributed by diffing the text behind the hashes
// (RENDER_TEXT_DIR, which exists for exactly this) rather than asserted:
//   GL, WC+GL, WC+GL+PR   "...the year's underwriting WITH MARGIN," -> "...the
//                         year's underwriting," — these fell in the new 0.70-1.00
//                         band, which drops the clause.
//   PR                    "with margin," -> "with margin TO SPARE," — 0.50-0.70.
//   WC                    a whole sentence APPEARED where there had been none:
//                         90.8% against 82.1% priced. The old scale's 0.90-1.00
//                         band printed nothing at all, so that year's loss result
//                         was silent. That silence is the defect the fifth band
//                         fixes, and this row is the evidence it existed.
// ⚠ THE CONTROL RAN FIRST AND ON A SEPARATE PORT: 6b90859 built into its own
// worktree and served on 4174 reproduced all 298 fingerprints. That is what
// rules out "the baseline had already drifted" — and it is the check that a
// previous recapture on this project got wrong by pointing the harness at the
// wrong server and reading a false all-clear.
// ⚠ COLOUR IS NOT IN THE FINGERPRINT. innerText carries no CSS classes, so the
// emerald/sky boundary moving from 0.90 to 0.70, and HistoryPage's and
// ResultsPage's combined ratios moving to their own scale, are INVISIBLE here.
// Those changes are real and this instrument did not and cannot see them.
// ⚠ v9 -> v10: THE CLAIMS MEMO PUT ON ONE VALUATION YEAR. Ten rows moved, every
// one `Departments|doc:Claims` at y0 and y2 across all five configurations, and
// every one the SAME cause — attributed by diffing the text behind the hashes
// (RENDER_TEXT_DIR) rather than asserted:
//   the evaluation date moves BACK one year   12/31/2026 -> 12/31/2025 at y0,
//   12/31/2028 -> 12/31/2027 at y2. The listing used to be dated at the year the
//   page had SELECTED — which defaults to the unplayed `currentYearNumber` —
//   while its Paid and Incurred came from live cohort state a year earlier. It
//   is now dated where the money is, which is also where the claims workbook
//   strikes. At y0 that is the last PRE-GAME year, which is why y0 moves at all.
//   the row sets and amounts follow, because claim status now resolves at the
//   same valuation as the figures beside it.
//   plus one added sentence saying which valuation the listing is struck at and
//   that the year selector does not move it.
// ⚠ doc:Actuarial DID NOT MOVE, and that is expected rather than lucky. Its
// developed-occurrence count was also wrong — always the latest year, whatever
// year was selected — but both year-points this harness captures select the
// current year, where the memo clamps to the latest valuation anyway. The fix
// is only visible on a HISTORICAL selection, which this instrument never makes.
// actuarial-memo-check covers it across all ten years; see the control there.

// ⚠ v10 -> v11: netIncurredLoss ADDED TO RESULT_METRICS, AND THE LABELS SHARED.
// Eighteen rows moved — 13 on Results (every configuration x every line scope,
// at y2) and 5 on Result Spreadsheet — attributed by diffing the text behind
// the hashes. Two causes and no third:
//   1. the added row, `Net Incurred Loss (the loss-ratio numerator)`, with its
//      figure and, on Results, its year-over-year change.
//   2. labels taken from RESULT_METRICS instead of retyped: `Pool Premium` ->
//      `Pool Premium at Selected CLF`, `Ultimate Losses (Gross)` -> `Gross
//      Ultimate Loss + LAE`, `Net Ultimate Loss` -> `... + LAE`, and the loss
//      ratio's `(prem + admin)` / `(pricing basis)` -> `(pricing basis —
//      premium + admin expense)` on both surfaces.
// ⚠ NO FIGURE CHANGED. The spreadsheet rows carry the same dollars either side;
// only a row appeared and four names were corrected.
// ⚠ Dashboard DID NOT MOVE, which is the expected result and worth recording.
// Its pricing-basis fallback was also wrong — a different numerator under a
// comment claiming it was the engine's — but the fallback fires only when
// `actualLossRatioPricingBasis` is ABSENT, and every save this harness plays
// carries it. The change is invisible here by construction, not by luck.

// ⚠ v11 -> v12: THE CLOSURE BAND PUT ON THE DRAW. 224 of 298 fingerprints
// moved, and that breadth is the point rather than a surprise: changing which
// claims are closed changes the developing set, which changes development
// allocation, which changes reserves, premium and every figure downstream.
// Classified mechanically rather than sampled — of the 224:
//   177  every changed token is a number
//    41  the same, with a suffix my first pass missed ('1.44x' -> '1.43x',
//        '$0.71M.' -> '$0.72M.')
//     6  a token COUNT change, each attributed individually:
//          3x Calculation Audit|GL|y0  the status badge going from '28 of 29
//             checks OK — 1 difference found' to 'All 29 checks OK'
//          3x Departments|doc:Claims|y2  one row of the top-ten open listing
//             REPLACED, e.g. '2024 Summit Recreation District 119' giving way
//             to '2026 Ashford County 047' — a claim's status flipped, which is
//             this change reaching the player-visible document.
// ⚠ PROPERTY-SOLO MOVED NOT AT ALL: GL 44, WC 44, WC+GL 60, WC+GL+PR 76, PR 0.
// Property has no CLOSURE_BY_SIZE split, so it has no band to resolve and the
// contraction cannot reach it. That is the confinement claim, and the export
// guard says the same thing independently — all six PR-solo workbooks are
// byte-identical across every metric, year and full-precision rendering.
// ⚠ AND TWO AUDIT CHECKS FLIP BOTH WAYS. 'Review' -> 'OK' on one row and 'OK'
// -> 'Review' on another, because their differences moved across a tolerance
// that is too tight to be stable — the bound is half a rounding unit for a
// check that sums two rounded rates. That is a SEPARATE defect, fixed in the
// commit after this one; it is recorded here because it is why some of these
// rows carry a word change rather than only numbers.

//                WC, $10,170 -> $10,178 on Property) because it now carries the
//                exposure rounding as well as the rate rounding, and the note
//                names both. The badge goes '28 of 29 — 1 difference found' to
//                'All 29 checks OK'.
//   pool scope   '$NaN' -> 'n/a' and 'Review' -> the n/a reason, on the two
//                rows whose recalculation needs a per-line CLF the pool has
//                not got; the badge goes '2 differences found, 3 not
//                applicable' to '5 not applicable'.
//   everywhere   'differences under $0' -> 'differences under one cent'.
// After it: 16 captures read 'All 29 checks OK' and the ten pooled ones read

//                           reading $0, plus the pool-layer and total ratios.
//   Result Spreadsheet (5)  the same three rows in the workbook table.
//   Calculation Audit (26)  '+ $0' and '+ 0 (retained cover margin rate)' —

//                           of total operating revenues.

// ============================================================================
// NORMALISATION — AND AN HONEST ACCOUNT OF WHAT IT COST, WHICH WAS LESS THAN
// EXPECTED. A comment here saying each rule was "added because a run disagreed
// with itself" would be a measurement claim, and it would be false: the two
// validation runs were identical on the FIRST attempt, so nothing below was
// forced by an observed disagreement. Every rule is PREVENTIVE, and the honest
// statement is that the app turned out not to render anything non-deterministic
// into its visible text — no clocks, no elapsed times, no animation state that
// survives into innerText, no random ids in text.
//
// The four things that ARE load-bearing, none of them discovered the hard way:
//   1. whitespace collapse   — the ruling's rule: a reflow is not a diff, a
//                              number is.
//   2. innerText not textContent — fingerprints what is VISIBLE, so a hidden
//                              tooltip or aria-only string stays out.
//   3. the double rAF in settle() — networkidle alone is not enough for a built
//                              SPA served from disk: the network goes idle long
//                              before React commits. Preventive, and the one

// one's body, so a single capture of the Departments tab fingerprints the
// document LIST plus whichever document happens to be the default. Everything
// else on that page — four of the five documents — was uncovered. It was found
// when ~900 words of player-facing risk-control copy landed and this harness
// reported the Departments rows as unchanged.
//
// ⚠ ALL FIVE ARE CAPTURED, NOT JUST THE ONE THAT PROMPTED THIS. The gap is
// structural — a default selection hides every non-default document — so fixing
// it for the document that exposed it would leave the identical hole for the
// other three and guarantee this is rediscovered. The two generated memos
// (Actuarial, Claims) are the higher-value coverage anyway: they are built from
// engine numbers by buildActuarialMemo/buildClaimsMemo, where the risk-control
// copy is mostly static prose.
//
// ⚠ THE LIST IS DETECTED, NOT LISTED, which is the lesson the line bar already
// taught this file. Hardcoding five titles would make the harness disagree with
// the page the moment a sixth document is added — and it would disagree
// SILENTLY, by capturing five of six. The buttons are DocumentReader's own
// <nav>, and an unbuilt document renders DISABLED, so "locked" is read off the
// control rather than guessed from a title.
//
// ⚠ AND THE EXISTING `-` ROW IS LEFT EXACTLY AS IT WAS. It is captured BEFORE
// any document is selected, so it still fingerprints the page as it OPENS,
// which is itself worth pinning — if the default document ever changes, that
// row moves and says so. The per-document rows are additions. Investment is
// therefore captured twice, once as the default and once by name; that is
// deliberate, not redundancy to tidy away.
