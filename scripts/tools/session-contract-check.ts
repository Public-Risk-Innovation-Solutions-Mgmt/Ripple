// ============================================================================
// THE SESSION CONTRACT HARNESS — the closest thing to a gate this layer gets.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS IS NOT IN scripts/diagnostics. The gate manifest asserts that every
// file in that directory is in exactly one tier, and the 68 gates plus both
// baselines exist to hold a DETERMINISTIC ENGINE still. This checks a session
// layer: tokens, claims, redaction and carry-forward. It shares no baseline with
// them and putting it there would either fail the manifest check or dilute what
// a green sweep means. It runs on its own:
//
//   npx tsx scripts/tools/session-contract-check.ts
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. The failure modes of a session layer are not numeric drift —
// they are a refresh that locks the real driver out of their own team, a host
// table that loses a lock to a race, a team silently reverted to engine defaults
// because it missed a deadline, and one team's decisions visible to another.
// Each of those is an assertion below.
//
// ⚠ IT RUNS TWICE: ONCE AGAINST EACH IMPLEMENTATION, AND THE ASSERTIONS ARE THE
// SAME OBJECT CODE BOTH TIMES. The localStorage one runs behind a memory shim;
// the HTTP one runs against the throwaway stub server over a real socket on
// 127.0.0.1. Nothing below the fixture line knows which is underneath — the only
// thing that changed to add the second pass was `transport()` returning a
// different object, which is the claim the contract was written to make. If a
// single assertion had needed weakening for one of them, THAT would have been
// the finding; none did.
//
// So it tests the contract, not the browser, and now demonstrably not the
// storage either.
