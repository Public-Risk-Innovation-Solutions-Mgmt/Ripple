// genuine because Property still ran the retired 125%-of-expected-loss
// REINSURANCE_PROGRAMS path — true when written, but Property got its own
// occurrence tower before that path was retired, and a tower attachment is
// exactly the per-occurrence-vs-annual-aggregate mismatch described above.
// There was no line, including Property, for which this split was still
// correct by the time it was deleted.
//
// "HistoryPage uses poolLosses correctly" WAS ALSO WRONG, for the same
// reason — toHistoricalYear echoes the same engine-computed fields, so a
// pre-game WC/GL/Property year pinned exactly like a live one. Both HistoryPage
// rows and this pool-card omission are gone together; see HistoryPage's own
// note on what replaces them (Reinsurance Recovery, Retained Above Tower).

// Every metric where the pool figure must equal the sum of its active lines.
// ⚠ THE KEY MUST EXIST ON BOTH ROWS, AND THE TYPE NOW SAYS SO. This card
// reconciles the pool figure against the sum of its lines, so it indexes a line
// row AND the pool row with the same key. `keyof LineResultSet` admitted keys
// the pool row does not have — a per-line key here would have summed the lines
// and compared the total against a placeholder. The intersection is the honest
// domain, and a future per-line key fails to compile rather than reconciling
