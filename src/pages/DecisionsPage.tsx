          rest of that game. Nothing normalises it on load, because silently
          rewriting a player's saved decisions is a worse failure than a stuck
          lever on a pre-existing save, and the commit that gives the boxes the
          field is where that normalisation belongs. New games are unaffected. */}

            "Pure Premium Rate / $100 (gross)" and "Less Expected Ceded / $100"
            were removed: a funding decision does not need them, and showing the
            gross figure at the top invites reading the pool's exposure as the
            whole of it rather than the part it retains. The tower's price is
            still on the panel — as the Reinsurance row below, which is what a
            member actually pays for it.

            ⚠ AND THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILD-UP IS NOW SHOWN, which is the point of
            this change. Pool Premium $3.50 became a Total Member Charge of
            $9.07 with nothing in between, so the $5.57 read as overhead. It is
            not: admin is ~10% of the charge and reinsurance ~50%.

            ⚠ THESE ARE THE INCOME STATEMENT'S OWN FIGURES, NOT A RATIO APPLIED
            TO THE DISPLAY. quoteLineRates defines
            totalMemberChargeRatePer100 = pool + admin + reins + retained
            cover margin, and the engine defines totalMemberCharge =
            (poolPremium + adminExpense) + reinsuranceCost + retainedCoverMargin
            from the same four quantities. The fourth row renders only when a
            layer is declined — it is an exact 0 otherwise — reinsurance off the
            runtime tower quote, admin off ADMIN_EXPENSE_RATIO_OF_PURE_PREMIUM.
            So the four rows below add up exactly rather than approximately, and
            panel-engine-parity-check asserts both components against the engine
            to 0.00e+0.

            ⚠ ONE BASIS NOTE, now that the gross row is not on screen to show it:
            ADMIN IS ON THE GROSS PURE PREMIUM while the pool premium rate is on
            the NET. That is deliberate and matches the engine — the pool
            adjusts, reserves and pays a ceded claim in full and only then
            recovers, so ceding transfers the loss and not the handling cost.

// at nothing. Property's primary-layer credibility is 0.000 at every split
// point tried, so every Property member's modifier is exactly 1.000.
//
// The reason is written in the MEMBER'S terms, not ours. "Reliability 0.000
// over disjoint three-year windows" is the measurement; "a typical member has
// about one property claim every other year" is the same fact in a form a
// pool administrator can check against their own experience.
// ⚠ PROPERTY SHOWS NOTHING — NOT A RATIO WITH THE TIER GREYED OUT, AND THE
// DIFFERENCE MATTERS.
//
// Property has a ratio in the arithmetic sense: actual over expected exists for
// any member with a ledger. Three reasons it is not rendered.
//
//   IT IS NULL BY CONSTRUCTION, NOT BY A SWITCH. clampedRatioFor returns
//     rated: false whenever CREDIBILITY_Z is 0, and Property's Z is 0 because
//     its measured reliability was 0.000 at every split point tried. So
//     `rawRatio` is null on every Property member and there is no number to
//     render without computing one specially — which would mean writing code to
//     surface a quantity the measurement says carries no signal.
//
//   AT 1.9 CLAIMS PER WINDOW THE NUMBER IS NOISE WEARING A DECIMAL POINT. A
//     member with no claims reads 0.00 and one with a single average claim
//     reads about 2.0. Rendering that as "0.00x" against "2.03x" invites a
//     reader to conclude one member is infinitely better run than the other,
//     when the two are one claim apart.
//
//   A GREYED-OUT NUMBER STILL RANKS. Showing the ratio with the tier disabled
//     is worse than showing nothing, because the Membership table would sort on
//     it and a player would act on the ordering whether or not a control was
//     attached. Disabling the decision does not disable the inference.
//
// So: the note below, and no column. Renewal Underwriting renders this in place
// of its boxes, and New Business Appetite appends it.

// RENEWAL UNDERWRITING — ACTIVE. The pool declines to renew members whose

// The share of a book above a given modifier moves as the roster changes, so
// a static "declines about 5%" would be wrong the first time membership
// shifted and would keep being wrong silently. The count is recomputed from
// the current book every render, by the SAME function the engine applies —
// so the number shown is the number that happens, not an estimate of it.
//
// ⚠ AND THE COUNT IS ONE YEAR'S, WHILE THE EFFECT COMPOUNDS. A declined
// member enters the two-year cooldown and cannot be recruited back, so a
// level held for several years shrinks the book by much more than its annual
// count suggests. Measured over 14 years with the level APPLIED, mean enrolled
// against renewal off: 2.50 takes WC from 90.6 to 81.4 and 2.00 takes it to
// 67.5. The note below says so, because the control cannot show it.
//
// ⚠ IT IS THIS YEAR'S ACTUAL COUNT AND IT SWINGS, WHICH READS AS A BUG AND IS
// NOT ONE. renewalDeclines is handed the CURRENT book, the CURRENT ledger and
// the CURRENT yearNumber and returns the actual list — no average, no forecast,
// the same call the engine makes when the year is processed. So the tile reading
// 7 one year and 0 the next is two true statements about two different years,
// not an unstable estimate of one quantity. A decline needs a member running
// more than the bar times their own expected cost, and few members do, so how
// many sit above it in a given year is a property of the loss draw.
//
// MEASURED, 8 games x 14 years on a Renew All history — this is the tile's own
// distribution, taken from the same call it renders, per line-year:
//
//   bar     line       mean   max   reads 0
//   2.50    WC         2.95     7     8.8%
//   2.50    GL         3.46     8     3.8%
//   2.00    WC         7.05    12     0.0%
//   2.00    GL         7.21    17     1.3%
//   any     Property   0.00     0    100.0%
//
// So BOTH SCREENSHOTS ARE ORDINARY at the mild bar: a 0 turns up in about one
// line-year in fifteen and a 7 is the top of the range. THE STRICT BAR BARELY
// READS 0 AT ALL, which is the clearest thing the second tile adds — it is not
// a finer setting of the same control, it is a different decision.
//
// ⚠ AND PROPERTY IS ALWAYS EXACTLY 0, which is not a swing at all — it has no
// rated members, so nothing can clear a threshold. It never shows this tile
// (PropertyNoSignalNote renders instead), so a 0 seen on screen came from WC or
// GL and is a real year rather than the degenerate line.
//
// ⚠ PER-APPLICANT OVERRIDE APPLIES HERE TOO, AND IS DEFERRED FOR THE SAME TWO

// whether that is strict; "Selective" says it. The threshold is still exact and
// still what the engine filters on — it is just not what the player is asked to
// reason about while choosing, and it is not on the tile.
//
// ⚠ THE ORDER AND THE NAME-TO-VALUE MAPPING BOTH LIVE AT
// NEW_BUSINESS_APPETITE_TIERS, not here. This row is one map over that list.
// The version before it held the order in the page and the values in the module
// and rendered an ascending array in reverse — correct, and one transposition
// away from pairing every count with the wrong name.
//
// ⚠ THE TIERS ONCE RENDERED 0.75 / 1.00 / 1.50 AFTER Accept All, which was open,
// then MOST closed, then loosening again. Nobody chose that; it was
// NEW_BUSINESS_TIERS in its own ascending order, which is the right order for a
// threshold list and the wrong one for a row of tiles.
//
// ⚠ THE SUBTITLE IS HOW MANY MEMBERS WOULD JOIN, AFTER THE CAP, AND IT USED TO
// BE NEITHER. It read "~3 of ~7" — a ratio, tilded, and computed before the
// intake cap. The threshold is already in the tile's title; the subtitle is what
// the choice costs.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS POST-CAP NOW, WHICH IT WAS NOT. intakeRoom = floor(book x
// MAX_NEW_MEMBER_SHARE) is the only intake limit left, and it BINDS — the share
// cap fires whenever applications exceed a tenth of the book, which the
// arithmetic in MAX_NEW_MEMBER_SHARE puts at any book below about 75 members.

// the tile moves with the book instead of sitting at 4.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ PER-APPLICANT ACCEPT/DECLINE IS DEFERRED, NOT PENDING, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS
// THE POINT OF THIS BLOCK. The tiered control is the shipped answer. What
// follows is recorded so the alternative is not redesigned from scratch by
// someone who assumes it was simply never got to.
//
// THE INTENDED SHAPE, IF IT IS EVER BUILT. The tier sets a DEFAULT and the
// player overrides individuals — it does not replace the tier. Set Selective,
// see this year's applicants with the ones it would take already selected, and
// change your mind on any of them. Renewals work the same way: the threshold
// FLAGS who it would decline and the player confirms or spares each one. The
// policy stays the thing you set; the overrides are the exceptions to it.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, WHICH IS WHY IT IS DEFERRED AND NOT SCHEDULED:
//
//   THE TABLE TIME. A dozen per-applicant decisions a year, across ten years and
//   five teams, is the whole session. This game is played in a facilitated room
//   against a clock, and a control that consumes the room is not a better
//   control however much more expressive it is. That is a fact about the
//   SETTING rather than about the UI, which is why no amount of interface work
//   retires it.
//
//   THE FORECAST GOES. The join-count tiles work because a tier is a POLICY —
//   the share of applicants clearing a bar is computable before the draw, so
//   the tile can say what the choice costs. Per-applicant has nothing to
//   forecast: the answer depends on choices the player has not made yet. So the
//   display would have to change too, from "N join" to a list with no summary,
