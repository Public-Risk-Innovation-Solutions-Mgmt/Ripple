// ============================================================================
// THE localStorage IMPLEMENTATION of SessionTransport.
//
// ⚠ THE FIRST IMPLEMENTATION, NOT THE DESIGN. Everything specific to
// localStorage is below this line and nothing above it (see contract.ts) knows
// this file exists. Screens import the interface and are handed an instance;
// none of them can tell what is underneath, which is the property the whole
// layer is for.
//
// WHY IT IS STILL ASYNC WHEN localStorage IS SYNCHRONOUS. Because the point is
// to build the client against the shape a network actually has. A synchronous
// API here would compile, work, and then require every call site to be rewritten
// the first time a request took 40ms and sometimes failed. The fake latency and
// the injectable fault are how the loading spinner and the error state get
// written and walked NOW, while the cost of getting them wrong is nothing.
//
// ⚠ MUTATIONS TAKE A CROSS-TAB LOCK, AND THIS WAS A BUG BEFORE THEY DID. Four
// tabs share one localStorage and there is no transaction. The first version of
// this file kept each read-modify-write in one synchronous block and argued that
// JavaScript being single-threaded made it un-interleavable. THAT ARGUMENT IS
// WRONG, and the four-tab run proved it within minutes: single-threadedness
// holds WITHIN a tab, but separate tabs are genuinely parallel, so tab A could
// read, tab B read, tab A write and tab B write — losing A's update entirely. It
// showed up as a team whose posted result silently never arrived, with the host
// table reporting it a year behind while its own screen showed the year computed
// and posted.
//
// navigator.locks is the right primitive: per ORIGIN, honoured across every tab,
// and it releases if a tab dies mid-hold. Every mutating endpoint runs its whole
// read-modify-write inside it. READS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT LOCKED — a poll is
// harmless against a half-finished sequence because each localStorage write is
// itself atomic, and serialising four pollers behind every write would make the
// lock the bottleneck it exists to avoid.
//
// Where the API is absent (the Node contract harness, an old browser) the work
// runs unlocked — correct there, because there is exactly one thread to race.
//
// The artificial latency is awaited BEFORE the lock is taken, never inside it,
// so a fake round trip cannot widen the window it is meant to be testing. A
// hosted implementation gets all of this from the server for free.

  /**
   * ⚠ A COMPARE-AND-SWAP ON THE ROOM'S CURRENT YEAR, AND THE ORDER OF THE FOUR
   * CASES BELOW IS LOAD-BEARING.
   *
   * `advance` increments, so a retried request — which is what a client sends
   * when a response is lost — used to SKIP A YEAR, and every team then reported
   * against a year nobody played. The two requests are byte-identical from the
   * server's side; `expectedYear` is what makes them distinguishable.
   *
   * ⚠ WRITTEN SO THE LAMBDA INHERITS IT. On DynamoDB this is one conditional
   * update on the HEADER item and only there: condition `currentYear = the
   * expected year`, still inside the year count, host token matches. On a
   * failed condition the handler reads the header back and distinguishes
   * exactly the four cases below. Here the lock makes the read-modify-write
   * atomic so the "readback" is just the record in hand — but the CASES are the
   * contract, and they are written out rather than collapsed so the hosted
   * implementation has something to match.
   *
   *   1. token mismatch            NOT_HOST   (BAD_TOKEN if it is nobody's)
   *   2. already at expected + 1   A RETRY — success, no write
   *   3. past the year count       GAME_COMPLETE
   *   4. anything else             WRONG_YEAR
   *
   * ⚠ CASE 2 PRECEDES CASE 3, AND SWAPPING THEM BREAKS THE LAST ADVANCE OF
   * EVERY GAME. Take yearCount 3 with the room on 4: a retry carrying
   * expectedYear 3 is a retry of the advance that COMPLETED the game and must
   * return success, while a fresh call carrying expectedYear 4 is a genuine
   * attempt to advance past the end and must be GAME_COMPLETE. Both see
   * `currentYear > yearCount`; only the expectation tells them apart.
   *
   * ⚠ AND A RETRY SUCCEEDS RATHER THAN FAILING POLITELY. Returning an error
   * saying "it already happened" would report a failure for an operation that
   * worked, to a host who can do nothing about it. `advanced` says which path
   * ran, so a caller that cares can tell.
   *
   * ⚠ THE WINDOW IS ONE YEAR WIDE, WHICH IS A REAL LIMIT AND NOT A BUG. A host
   * on a stale screen whose room has moved on by exactly one gets a success and
   * no second advance — indistinguishable from a retry, by construction, and
   * the safe failure of the two. Two or more years stale is WRONG_YEAR.
