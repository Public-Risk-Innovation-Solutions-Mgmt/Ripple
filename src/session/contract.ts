// ============================================================================
// THE SESSION CONTRACT — five endpoints, one interface, no implementation.
//
// ⚠ THIS FILE IS THE DELIVERABLE. localStorage is the FIRST implementation of
// it, not the design. A second implementation against HTTP must drop in with no
// client change, and everything in this file exists to make that true. If a
// swap to a hosted backend turns out to touch anything above this layer, the
// fault is here, not there.
//
// THREE RULES THAT MAKE THE SWAP A BASE-URL CHANGE RATHER THAN A REWRITE:
//
//   1. EVERY PAYLOAD IS PLAIN JSON. No class instances, no Date objects, no
//      functions, no Map/Set. Timestamps are epoch millis. A request object is
//      exactly what a POST body would carry and a response object is exactly
//      what one would return, so `JSON.stringify(req)` over `fetch` is the
//      whole of the HTTP implementation's marshalling.
//
//   2. AUTHORITY TRAVELS AS A TOKEN FIELD ON THE REQUEST. Not as connection
//      state, not as a module-level "current user", not as something the
//      transport remembers between calls. Every call that needs authority
//      carries it explicitly, so the HTTP implementation lifts that field into
//      an `Authorization` header and changes nothing else. A transport that
//      remembered who you were would be a transport that could not be
//      statelessly re-pointed.
//
//   3. THE ENGINE'S DATA IS OPAQUE. `decisions` and `result` are JsonValue and
//      this layer NEVER looks inside them. It stores them, hands them back, and
//      carries the last one forward. That is what keeps the session layer from
//      growing a second, divergent opinion about what a decision is — and it is
//      why nothing in src/utils had to change to make multiplayer work.
//
// ASYNC AND FALLIBLE FROM DAY ONE. Every method returns a promise and every
// method can reject. That is not defensive padding: the localStorage
// implementation is synchronous underneath and could have exposed a synchronous
// API, which would have compiled fine and then needed every call site rewritten
// the first time a real network appeared. Loading and failure states get built
// and exercised now, against a fake latency and an injectable fault, rather than
// discovered against the first real network.
// ============================================================================
