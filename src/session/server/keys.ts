// ============================================================================
// THE DYNAMODB KEY DESIGN FOR THE SESSION LAYER — AND THE ONLY PLACE A KEY IS
// BUILT.
//
// ⚠ THIS FILE IS AUTHORITATIVE. docs/SESSION_DYNAMODB.md is a summary of it for
// whoever provisions the table; where the two disagree, this file is right and
// the note is stale. The design lives here rather than in httpTransport.ts
// (whose list is what the CLIENT cannot fix) or the stub server (whose header
// says nothing in it survives) because anyone writing the Lambda has to import
// this module to build any key — so this header is where they will be standing.
//
// ⚠ NOTHING IMPORTS IT YET. It records a design; no handler exists. Every value
// below that is a size or a count says whether it was MEASURED, DERIVED or
// ESTIMATED, because on this project those have been confused before and it
// cost a re-solve each time.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE THREE THINGS THE TABLE CANNOT BE CREATED WITHOUT — none can be changed
// after the table exists.
//
//   table name          ripple-sessions
//                       The handler reads it from the TABLE_NAME environment
//                       variable (the AWS owner's guide sets it) and never
//                       hard-codes it, so a staging table can differ.
//   partition key       attribute  pk   type String (S)
//   sort key            attribute  sk   type String (S)
//   TTL attribute       expiresAtSec    type Number (N), EPOCH SECONDS
//
// ⚠ THE ATTRIBUTE IS NOT THE VALUE. The attribute is CALLED `pk`; its VALUE is
// ROOM#<code>. The attribute is called `sk`; its values are ROOM, NAME#..., D#...,
// R#..., VIEW#.... Nobody types ROOM#<code> into the console. The names are
// generic on purpose: one attribute carries several kinds of value, so a
// meaningful name (`roomCode`, `year`) would be wrong for at least one of them.
//
// ⚠ expiresAtSec IS SECONDS, AND THE NAME SAYS SO BECAUSE ITS NEIGHBOURS ARE
// MILLISECONDS. createdAt and updatedAt are Date.now(), as localTransport stamps
// them. A TTL stamped in milliseconds reads to DynamoDB as a date tens of
// thousands of years away, and nothing is EVER deleted — silently. Compute it as
// Math.floor(ms / 1000) + retention. A DURATION stored where a timestamp belongs
// fails the other way: an absolute time in 1970, expired at once.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT SETS THE EXPIRY — ONE WRITE SETS IT, EVERY OTHER WRITE COPIES IT.
//
//   createRoom   sets the header's expiresAtSec ONCE:
//                  Math.floor(createdAt / 1000) + retention seconds.
//                The retention length is not decided here. Unlike the three
//                names above it can change later — for new rooms.
//   every other write copies the HEADER'S value VERBATIM onto the item it writes:
//                  join     -> NAME#     viewer join -> VIEW#
//                  submit   -> D#, R#
//                Each of those already reads the header first, to resolve the
//                token or confirm the room and team exist, so the value is in
//                hand. No write computes an expiry from "now", and no write
//                extends it.
//
// ⚠ A LATE ITEM GETS THE ROOM'S EXPIRY, NOT ITS OWN. A year-10 result posted two
// hours after createRoom carries the same absolute expiresAtSec as the header
// written at the start. If writes stamped "now + retention" instead, the room
// would expire in pieces: the header first, its last results hours later —
// orphans a reader could still find.
//
// ⚠ AND IDENTICAL STAMPS STILL DO NOT DELETE A ROOM AT ONCE. TTL deletion is a
// background process that runs well after the expiry, item by item. So:
//   * a header past its expiresAtSec is ROOM_NOT_FOUND, whether or not TTL has
//     removed it yet — reads and writes check the stamp, not the item's presence;
//   * an absent header is ROOM_NOT_FOUND even if D#/R# items of that room
//     linger;
//   * createRoom's attribute_not_exists guards only the header, so a new room
//     drawing the code of a recently expired one could inherit its leftover
//     items. Rare at 32^6 codes; the guard for it is to refuse a code whose
//     partition has ANY item (Query, Limit 1), not just a header.
//
// ============================================================================
// ONE TABLE. ONE PARTITION PER ROOM — PLUS ONE INDEX ITEM THAT CANNOT BE IN ONE.
//
//   pk = ROOM#<code>            every item of a room shares it
//
//   sk                          holds (every item also carries expiresAtSec)
//   ------------------------    ------------------------------------------------
//   ROOM                        THE HEADER. seed, eventName, yearCount,
//                               startingYear, expectedTeams, shocks,
//                               currentYear, rev, createdAt, updatedAt,
//                               expiresAtSec (the room's, set once),
//                               hostTokenHash, and the ROSTER:
//                                 { [teamId]: { name, lines, joined, lockedYear,
//                                               tokenHash, posted: { [year]: true } } }
//   NAME#<trimmed team name>    { teamId }. Exists only so a name is claimed once.
//   D#<teamId>#<yyy>            one team's DECISIONS for one year (opaque JSON).
//   R#<teamId>#<yyy>            one team's RESULT for one year (TeamYearSummary).
//                               Year 000 is the opening position.
//   VIEW#<tokenHash>            { teamId } for one viewer.
//
// ⚠ AND ONE ITEM THAT IS NOT IN A ROOM'S PARTITION, WHICH IS WHY THE HEADING
// ABOVE IS QUALIFIED. createRoom became idempotent after this design was first
// written: the host mints its own token and the server indexes it, so a retry
// returns the room already made. That lookup happens BEFORE a code is known, so
// the item cannot be keyed on the code.
//
//   pk = CREATE#<hash(hostToken)>   sk = CREATE      { code }
//
//   * HASHED, NOT RAW. The local implementation keys on the token itself and
//     says so — the room record beside it already holds the token in the clear
//     in the same localStorage, so it is no worse THERE. A hosted table is a
//     different setting: key on the hash and no plaintext bearer token is ever
//     written. The contract does not constrain this because it is entirely the
//     server's side of the wire.
//   * IT IS A SECOND ITEM PER ROOM, and anything counting rooms must exclude it.
//     The local store's /health reported `store.length` as the room count and
//     went wrong the moment this landed — the two-contexts driver caught it as
//     "the SERVER holds the room (2)" after a single create.
//   * WRITE IT AFTER THE ROOM, NEVER BEFORE. A failure between the two then
//     leaves no index pointing at a room that was never written; the reverse
//     order strands a token that resolves to nothing. They are deliberately NOT
//     transacted: they are in different partitions, and the ordering makes the
//     non-atomic case harmless in one direction only.
//   * GIVE IT THE ROOM'S OWN expiresAtSec. A longer life outlives the room it
//     names and a shorter one silently un-idempotents a create that is still
//     live. Same stamp, same reasoning as every other item here.
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE, point by point:
//
//   * THE ROSTER IS IN THE HEADER because every `read` fetches the header
//     anyway (it carries `rev`, the ETag), so resolving a host or player token
//     costs no extra call. Tokens are stored HASHED; the header is never
//     returned raw.
//   * TEAMS ARE KEYED BY A RANDOM teamId, NOT BY NAME. Names are user text and
//     may contain '#'. Uniqueness comes from the NAME# item instead, keyed on
//     the name exactly as localTransport compares it today: trimmed, CASE-
//     SENSITIVE. Case-folding would be a behaviour change and a separate
//     decision.
//   * DECISIONS AND RESULTS ARE SEPARATE PREFIXES, NOT NESTED UNDER THE TEAM.
//     That makes the host's whole read ONE contiguous range (begins_with R#)
//     and keeps decisions physically out of the host's query, so "the host
//     never sees a team's decisions" does not depend on a filter someone could
//     forget. It is still enforced in code, not by the key — see HARD, 6.
//   * VIEWERS ARE THEIR OWN ITEMS because the viewer list grows with the number
//     of watchers, not with teams or years, and has no business in the header.
//   * `status` IS NOT STORED. It is derived from currentYear and the roster, as
//     localTransport derives it today; storing it would be one more field to
//     keep in step.
//   * YEARS ARE PADDED TO THREE DIGITS so the sort order holds past 99. padYear
//     below refuses anything else rather than truncating.

//
// ⚠ THE DECISIONS CONDITION MATTERS AS MUCH AS ADVANCE'S. Today the lock makes
// "check the year, then write" atomic. Split across items without that
// condition, a year-3 decision could land AFTER year 3 was processed, and a
// reloaded client would replay numbers nobody played — the slot-history bug
// that made decisions a history in the first place, back by another door.
//
// ⚠ ADVANCE'S COMPARE-AND-SWAP IS ON THE HEADER AND NOWHERE ELSE. It touches
// no team item: "locked" is derived as lockedYear === currentYear, so a new
// year needs no reset. On ConditionalCheckFailed, read the old header
// (ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure = ALL_OLD) and decide:
//   already at :e + 1   -> the request was a retry; return success and the room
//   past yearCount      -> GAME_COMPLETE
//   host hash mismatch  -> NOT_HOST
//   anything else       -> WRONG_YEAR
// AdvanceRequest CARRIES :e NOW — `expectedYear`, required, not optional. This
// said it did not yet; that was true when this was written and stopped being
// true on another branch. The retry branch above is therefore reachable and a
// server must implement it: a retry SUCCEEDS with advanced: false, it does not
// error.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ rev IS NOT THE WRITE GUARD. httpTransport.ts item 8 and the stub server's
// header used to say it should be, and that is superseded here.
//
// rev stays monotonic per write and stays the ETag. It is bumped with an
// unconditional ADD inside each write's transaction. It is NOT a
// ConditionExpression on any write, because guarding writes on rev makes every
// write in a room conditional on one value: any two teams writing at once
// conflict and retry, which is exactly the contention the header-plus-items
// split exists to remove. Once writes are per item there is no whole-room
// read-modify-write left to guard; each write is guarded on the field it
// depends on — currentYear, or whether a key exists.
//
// Nor is rev the right guard for advance even there: a host who read at rev r
// and clicked would be refused whenever any team posted in between, and in the
// minute after an advance teams are posting constantly. The expected YEAR is
// the guard; rev is only how a poller knows something moved.
//
// ============================================================================
// READ — ONE ENDPOINT, ONE CLIENT CALL, THE QUERY CHOSEN BY ROLE.
//
//   1. BatchGetItem [ROOM, VIEW#<hash(token)>] — resolves every role in one
//      round trip. If rev equals the client's If-None-Match, answer 304 here.
//   2. By role:
//        host       Query begins_with R#              ~87 KB at 10x10
//        player     Query begins_with D#<teamId>#     ~11 KB; postedYears come
//                                                     from the roster
//        viewer     as the player it watches
//        anonymous  the header alone, token hashes stripped
//
// The response SHAPE does not change. What changes: players and anonymous
// callers stop receiving other teams' resultsByYear, which no screen of theirs
// reads — see the note at localTransport's teamView, where that over-send lives
// on the current build.
//
// ⚠ EVERY READ IS STRONGLY CONSISTENT (ConsistentRead = true), AND THIS IS WHY.
// A poller that sees a new rev on the header and then gets a STALE query would
// store that new rev as its ETag — and every later poll would 304 against it,
// so the missed item is never fetched. That is the lost-update bug in its fourth
// form: the first was four tabs sharing localStorage, the second the transport
// with nothing to serialise, the third Lambda's parallel invocations. For the
// same reason the read path uses NO secondary index: a GSI cannot be read
// strongly consistently.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THIS DESIGN MAKES HARD — six things, most important first.
//
//   1. TEAM COUNT x BURSTINESS BREAKS FIRST, NOT YEARS. Every write goes
//      through the header. Results arrive in a burst: every client sees the
//      advance on its next poll and posts within seconds. Two transactions on
//      one item at once conflict and one retries. At 10-12 teams that is
//      occasional; at 50+ posting inside a second or two it is sustained
//      retries and visible latency. Each write also pays for the WHOLE header's
//      size, which grows with the roster (~3 KB at 10 teams, ~25 KB at 100).
//      Escape hatch if it ever matters: results stop touching the header —
//      postedYears comes from a Query of R#<teamId>#, rev becomes an
//      unconditional ADD outside the transaction.
//      ⚠ THE PLANNED EVENT IS INSIDE THAT RANGE. The AWS owner's guide plans for
//      140 players — 25 to 45 teams at three to six a team — which sits between
//      "occasional" and "sustained", where nothing has been measured. The
//      escape hatch may not be optional for that event; decide before it.
//   2. ANY QUESTION ACROSS ROOMS. Rooms by host, rooms active this week, an
//      admin list: each is a table Scan. A GSI added later fixes it, but only
//      for questions chosen in advance, and a GSI is eventually consistent.
//   3. DELTAS. The ETag is all-or-nothing: any change and the host refetches
//      every result. A `sinceRev` read needs each item stamped with the rev
//      that wrote it, which a write cannot know without guarding on rev —
//      which is point 1's problem. Affordable (~10 MB a session to the host);
//      not cheap to change later.
//   4. A SCOREBOARD FOR PLAYERS. The growth direction to watch hardest. If
//      players are ever shown other teams, every player's poll becomes
//      host-sized — ~87 KB x every client x every change. That wants a small
//      per-team "latest figures" entry in the header, not the full history.
//   5. REMOVING A ROOM. It is ~220 items, not one. Every item needs its own
//      expiresAtSec copied from the header's (see WHAT SETS THE EXPIRY), TTL
//      removes them one by one rather than as a room, and an explicit delete is
//      a Query followed by batched deletes.
//   6. PRIVACY IS ENFORCED BY CODE, NOT BY KEYS. The layout keeps decisions out
//      of the host's query, but nothing in DynamoDB stops a handler reading D#
//      for the host. It is a handler rule and needs the harness to hold it.
//
// ============================================================================
// CONTRACT GAPS THIS DESIGN ASSUMED CLOSED — ALL THREE ARE NOW ACTUALLY CLOSED.
//
// This file was written against three gaps it could only assume would be shut.
// They were shut on another branch and arrive with this merge, so the design no
// longer assumes anything; it DESCRIBES the wire:
//   advance      AdvanceRequest.expectedYear, REQUIRED. Compare-and-swap on
//                currentYear = :expected. A retry is a no-op that SUCCEEDS.
//   join         JoinRequest.token, minted by the client and sent on the FIRST
//                join as well as a return. Still OPTIONAL on the wire, so a
//                handler must serve both the idempotent and the one-shot form.
//   createRoom   CreateRoomRequest.hostToken, minted by the client, doubling as
//                the idempotency key, with the CREATE# index item above.
//
// ⚠ THE CONTRACT HARNESS IS 144/144 OVER BOTH TRANSPORTS. It was 126/126 when
// this design was written — the figure STATE_member-satisfaction.md still
// records, correctly, as the count AT THAT MERGE. The extra eighteen are these
// three mechanisms. They run identically against localStorage and over a real
// socket, so a handler that satisfies the harness satisfies the contract, and
// the harness is the thing to run against a Lambda, not this header.
