// ============================================================================
// THE HOST'S RANDOMISED SHOCK SCHEDULE — drawn ONCE, at room creation, by the
// host's client, and written into the room as concrete entries.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS THE ONE PLACE A SHOCK SCHEDULE IS EVER DRAWN, AND WHERE IT IS
// CALLED FROM IS THE WHOLE RULE. HostCreateScreen calls it; nothing else may.
// Not a player's client, not the engine, not per year. The room record carries
// the result as a plain list and every team's build reads THAT list
// (buildGame.ts -> generateGameInstance), so every team faces the same
// schedule because they all read the same record — not because they all ran the
// same draw. A draw anywhere downstream of the room would make agreement a
// matter of every client computing identically, which is the property this
// design exists not to depend on.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS STILL REPRODUCIBLE. The draw is a pure function of the room's
// seed and year count, both of which the room record holds, so the schedule a
// room carries can be re-derived from the record alone and checked against it.
// It is keyed on its own purpose label, so it shares no stream with the game:
// the seed that builds the instance also seeds this, without either moving the
// other.
