// ============================================================================
// THE TEAMS TAB — one row per team, scanned for outliers.
//
// ⚠ A SUMMARY, NOT THE TEAM'S PAGES. Five figures and a name. The host is
// looking for who is in trouble, not diagnosing why; the per-team drill-down is
// a later tab and deliberately not this one.
//
// ⚠ THE LINE VIEW IS WHAT MAKES THE TABLE COMPARABLE AT ALL. Teams pick their
// own lines, so a pooled surplus blends a WC-only book with a three-line book
// and the column stops meaning one thing. On a line view every figure in a
// column is the same line. The Pool view still shows the aggregate, which is
// what the aggregate means everywhere else in this app — it is the right answer
// to a different question, not a worse answer to this one.
//
// ⚠ THREE STATES, AND THEY ARE STRUCTURALLY DIFFERENT RATHER THAN DIFFERENTLY
// COLOURED. This is the same distinction the Membership page draws, and it was
// worth more than a shade there too:
//
//   ABSENT   the team does not write this line. Not zero, and not late. The row
//            collapses to ONE cell saying so, because five dashes across five
//            numeric columns is exactly the thing somebody reads as a result.
//   PENDING  the team writes it and has not posted this year yet. Also one cell,
//            naming the year it is waiting on.
//   REPORTED five numbers.
//
// A row in any of the three is still a row: the team is always listed, because
// "which teams exist" is not the question any of these three answers.
//
// ⚠ IT SHOWS THE LAST COMPLETED YEAR, NOT THE CURRENT ONE. Results describe a
// year already played, so the host advances to year N and teams then report
// N-1. Between advances that is the newest thing there is, and a host waiting on
// a slow team should be reading it rather than a blank.
