// ============================================================================
// THE HTTP IMPLEMENTATION of SessionTransport — the second one, and the whole
// point of there having been a contract.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE IS EVIDENCE OF. contract.ts claimed that a hosted backend
// costs "a class implementing the five methods by POSTing its request object to
// `${BASE_URL}/<method>` and mapping status codes onto SessionErrorCode —
// because requests are already plain JSON and authority is already a token
// field, there is nothing to translate". This is that class, and the claim held:
// there is no marshalling below, because every request object already IS a body
// and every response object already IS a body.
//
// ⚠ NO navigator.locks HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF A SERVER. The localStorage
// implementation takes a cross-tab lock because the CLIENT performs the
// read-modify-write and four tabs doing that in parallel lost an update — a
// team's posted result silently vanished. Over HTTP the client does not read,
// modify or write anything: it sends a request and is told what happened. The
// serialisation is the server's problem, which is where it belongs. See the
// stub server's header for what that costs in Node (nothing) and what it will
// cost on Lambda (a conditional write), because those are different answers.
//
// ⚠ THE TOKEN GOES IN A HEADER AND ALSO STAYS IN THE BODY. The contract says
// authority "travels as a token field on the request" so that an HTTP
// implementation can "lift that field into an Authorization header". It is
// lifted — a real API gateway authorizer reads headers, not bodies — and left in
// place as well, so a server that has not been taught about the header still
// works. Neither is a translation of the other: they carry the same string.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT A DEPLOYMENT STILL NEEDS, BEYOND A BASE URL.
//
// ⚠ THESE ARE FINDINGS FROM MEASURING THIS TRANSPORT AGAINST THE STUB, AND THEY
// ARE HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE SOMEONE WRITING THE REAL SERVER WILL BE
// STANDING. Two of them were already written down — in the stub server, whose
// own header says nothing in it survives the real implementation — and the rest
// existed only in a commit message. A finding nobody reading the code will see
// is not recorded. None of this is a defect in the client below; it is the list
// of things the client cannot fix from its side.
//
// 1. CORS — AND THE PART THIS NOTE USED TO GET WRONG. The stub answers `*`; a
//    deployment names its origins, and `*` stops being legal at all the moment
//    a credentialed request is involved. That much stands.
//
//    ⚠ WHAT WAS WRONG: this said the HANDLER must put CORS headers on its 4xx
//    and 5xx responses "including the ones API Gateway generates itself". The
//    AWS owner verified the actual behaviour, and it is the other way round at
//    the level that matters: the GATEWAY supplies CORS on responses that come
//    FROM the handler, and NOT on the errors the gateway generates on its own —
//    a 429 from throttling, an unknown route, a request that never reached the
//    handler at all. So a handler cannot fix those from its side: by the time
//    the gateway answers, no handler ran. Both readings are true at different
//    levels, which is how the note survived.
//
//    ⚠ SO THOSE REACH THE BROWSER AS A CORS FAILURE, AND THE FIX IS CLIENT-SIDE:
//    treat a failure you cannot read as RETRYABLE. ✅ THIS CLIENT ALREADY DOES,
//    and not by having anticipated it — a CORS failure makes `fetch` REJECT with
//    a TypeError rather than resolve, so there is no Response to inspect and it
//    is indistinguishable from a dropped connection. It lands in the catch below
//    and is thrown as TRANSPORT_FAILURE with retryable hardcoded `true`. Nothing
//    to change here; it is recorded so nobody "fixes" it into reading a status.
//
//    ⚠ WHAT THAT COSTS, SO IT IS NOT MISTAKEN FOR FREE. A throttled 429 retries,
//    which is right. An unknown route ALSO retries, forever, because it looks
//    identical — the client degrades to repeated attempts rather than a clear
//    error. That is the acceptable side of the trade only while routes are
//    correct; it means a routing mistake in a deployment presents as a hang, not
//    as a 404. Configure the gateway's own error responses with CORS headers if
//    you want that distinction back — it is a gateway setting, not a handler one.
//
// 2. HTTPS, NOT OPTIONALLY. A bearer token in a header over plaintext is
//    readable by anything on the path, and a page served over https cannot call
//    an http API at all: mixed content is blocked before the request is made.
//
// 3. THE TOKEN LIFECYCLE. A token today is a random 32-character string minted
//    by the server and checked by equality. It never expires, cannot be
//    revoked, and grants its holder that team (or the room) forever. A
//    deployment needs a TTL, rotation and revocation, and ideally an authorizer
//    in front so a dead token never reaches the handler.
//
// 4. ✅ DONE — `advance` IS IDEMPOTENT. AdvanceRequest carries `expectedYear`
//    and the transport compare-and-swaps on it. ⚠ WHAT THE LAMBDA MUST
//    REPRODUCE, because the local implementation gets atomicity from a lock and
//    a hosted one will not: ONE conditional update on the HEADER item and only
//    there — condition `currentYear = expectedYear`, still inside the year
//    count, host token matches. On a FAILED condition, read the header back and
//    distinguish exactly four cases, in this order:
//
//      1. token mismatch            NOT_HOST  (BAD_TOKEN if it is nobody's)
//      2. already at expected + 1   A RETRY — return SUCCESS and the room
//      3. past the year count       GAME_COMPLETE
//      4. anything else             WRONG_YEAR
//
//    ⚠ CASE 2 BEFORE CASE 3, OR THE LAST ADVANCE OF EVERY GAME BREAKS. With
//    yearCount 3 and the room on 4, a retry carrying expectedYear 3 is a retry
//    of the advance that completed the game and must succeed, while a fresh
//    call carrying expectedYear 4 must be GAME_COMPLETE. Both see
//    `currentYear > yearCount`; only the expectation separates them.
//
//    ⚠ AND THE RETRY RETURNS SUCCESS, NOT A POLITE ERROR. An error would report
//    a failure for an operation that worked, to a host who can do nothing about
//    it. `AdvanceResponse.advanced` says which path ran.
//
// 5. ✅ DONE — `createRoom` AND `join` ARE IDEMPOTENT, by a client-generated
//    token. The client mints the bearer token and sends it, so a retry presents
//    the same one: createRoom keys an index on it and returns the room it
//    already made (`reused: true`), and join matches it on the rejoin path
//    instead of answering TEAM_TAKEN to the player who just created the team.
//    ⚠ THE HOSTED INDEX MUST BE KEYED ON A HASH of the token, not the token, so
//    no plaintext bearer token is written to the table — the local transport
//    keys on the token itself because the room record beside it already holds
//    it in the clear in the same localStorage, which a server does not.
//    ⚠ AND THE COLLISION GUARD IS NOT OPTIONAL: a supplied token already owned
//    by another team, a viewer or the host must be REFUSED, or moving the mint
//    to the client becomes a way to claim a seat by presenting its token.
//    The room-code collision check is still a read-then-write (`store.getItem`
//    then retry), which on DynamoDB is the racy pattern by definition — it
//    wants a conditional put with `attribute_not_exists(code)`.
//    `submit` is already idempotent per (team, year) and needs nothing.
//
// 6. THE ROOM IS ONE ITEM AND DYNAMODB CAPS AN ITEM AT 400 KB. Measured: 31 KB
//    at 2 teams x 8 years, ~190 KB extrapolated at 10 teams x 10 years. That is
//    two-times headroom on a record that grows with both dimensions, and the
//    cap is not negotiable. Split it into a room header plus one item per team —
//    which also removes most of the write contention in (7), because two teams
//    posting simultaneously would no longer be writing the same item.
//    ⚠ DESIGNED: src/session/server/keys.ts — a header item plus one item per
//    team-year for decisions and for results, with the sizes and which of them
//    are measured. That file is authoritative; this item is the reason for it.
//
// 7. POLLING IS METERED NOW. Every client reads the WHOLE room on every poll;
//    the back-off in pollSchedule.ts cuts the request count by ~60% and does
//    nothing about the payload. It wants an ETag on `rev` with
//    If-None-Match, or a `sinceRev` parameter — `rev` is already monotonic per
//    write and was built to be exactly this token, and is the same token the
//    conditional write in (8) needs.
//
// 8. navigator.locks IS UNNECESSARY HERE AND NECESSARY ON LAMBDA — the same
//    lost-update bug in its third form. The first form was four browser tabs
//    sharing one localStorage with no transaction, which cost a team's posted
//    result before the lock landed. The second is this transport, where the
//    client performs no read-modify-write at all and the lock has nothing to
//    serialise. The third is Lambda: concurrent invocations are genuinely
//    parallel processes, so the server's own read-modify-write must become a
//    conditional write — `ConditionExpression` on `rev`, retry on failure — or
//    per-item updates per (6). Single-threaded Node is what makes the stub safe
//    without one, and nothing about Lambda inherits that.
//    ⚠ SUPERSEDED: THE CONDITION IS NOT ON `rev`. The design took the per-item
//    branch, and in it each write is guarded on the field it depends on —
//    currentYear for decisions and advance, attribute_not_exists for create
//    and join. Guarding every write on `rev` would make any two teams writing
//    at once conflict, which reinstates the contention (6) exists to remove.
//    `rev` stays monotonic and stays the ETag of (7). The conditions, and why,
//    are in src/session/server/keys.ts.
