  // ⚠ THE PRICING BASIS, AND THE LABEL SAYS SO. Read this before changing it.
  //
  // This chip rendered `actualLossRatio` — netIncurredLoss / totalMemberCharge,
  // the MEMBER-CHARGE basis — under the label "Pool Loss Ratio". Two playtesters
  // independently read the result as a calibration failure and it was not one.
  //
  // WHY THAT DENOMINATOR CANNOT CARRY A HEADLINE. totalMemberCharge includes the
  // reinsurance premium, which is 41-50% of the charge depending on line. So a
  // pool whose retained book is running at 81% displays 44%, and "correctly
  // priced" and "giving money away" look identical.
  //
  // ⚠ AND THE LEVEL WAS THE SMALLER HALF OF IT. The reinsurance premium and the
  // admin charge are near-constant while losses are not, so the wide denominator
  // COMPRESSES THE RANGE: measured on one WC line, a year at 117% of retained
  // premium displayed 57% and a year at 63% displayed 31%. Every year reads
  // "fine". A player cannot tell a bad year from a good one, which is worse than
  // reading the wrong level, because the level is at least consistently wrong.
  //
  // WHY THE PRICING BASIS AND NOT PREMIUM ALONE. poolPremiumAndAdminExpense is
  // expectedLossRatio's own denominator, so the headline actual and the pricing
  // expectation are finally the same quantity and may be compared. That is
  // finding 6's entire point and it had never been true in a figure a player
  // looks at. Net loss over retained premium alone is the plainer statement and
  // it IS shown — on the Results detail and in the export — but it has no
  // expected counterpart to sit beside, so it is not the headline.
  //
  // THE MEMBER-CHARGE FIGURE IS NOT GONE. It is still on the result, still
  // exported, and still displayed where its basis is written out in full:
  // ResultsPage's detail rows, resultMetrics, and the audit page.
