// ============================================================================
// THE FIVE RISK-CONTROL TILES — compact, in the pool-wide card, where the
// retired intensity slider used to sit.
//
// ⚠ INERT. These tiles take no value, emit no change, and touch no decision
// field. Nothing here does anything yet.
//
// ⚠ AND THE SLIDER THEY REPLACE IS GONE. Until two commits ago the Loss
// Prevention card carried a live "Risk Control Investment" slider.
// `decisions.riskControlPct` REMAINS in the decision set, is still read by the
// engine, and is now pinned at its default of 0 — so the pool spends nothing on
// risk control until these tiles are given the field. The control went, not the
// decision. Do not wire a tile to riskControlPct as a half-step; the intended
// path is ONE commit that gives them the field outright.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, AND THE UNDERWRITING ROWS THEY COPY ARE.
//
// The visual reference is DecisionsPage's PreviewBox rows — Renew All / Decline
// above 2.50x, and Open through No New Business. Those are ONE choice from a
// set, and their whole design says so: exactly one tile carries the blue
// `selected` state, so the row reads as a dial with positions.
//
// These are five INDEPENDENT programs. A pool can buy all five, none, or any
// mixture, and reading them as a pick-one would be reading the opposite of the
// mechanic. Three things keep them apart, and the first is the load-bearing one:
//
//   1. NO SELECTED STATE EXISTS HERE AT ALL. PreviewBox is deliberately NOT
//      reused. It takes a `selected` boolean and paints exactly one tile blue;
//      importing it would have made the pick-one reading the default and left
//      only the caption to argue against it.
//   2. EACH TILE CARRIES ITS OWN STATUS SLOT rather than sharing one highlight.
//      Today every slot reads "Not active" because nothing is wired. When these
//      become live that slot is where per-tile on/off goes — five independent
//      states, which is a shape a single shared highlight cannot express.
//   3. A ONE-LINE CAPTION SAYS IT IN WORDS. The visual grammar does the work,
//      but a player should not have to infer the rule from styling.
//
// ⚠ AND THEY ARE DIVS, NOT BUTTONS, WHICH IS ALSO A TEST DECISION. An inert
// button is a lie about interactivity, and it would put five new entries into
// the button role on a page two session drivers query by button name. One tile
// is called "Property Mitigation"; the drivers' line-tab regex is anchored
// (/^Property$/) so it would not match today, but a div cannot collide at all
// and costs nothing.
//
// ⚠ THE CARD TITLE MUST NOT CONTAIN THE STRING "Risk Control Investment", and
// the reason OUTLIVED the slider. full-session.cjs and replay-fidelity.cjs find
// a slider by walking UP from every range input looking for its label text in an
// ancestor within five levels. Both were repointed to "Funding Confidence Level"
// when the slider went, so neither searches for the old label now — but this
// card shares a grid with Investment Allocation, and the next range input added
// to that grid would inherit the trap. The title is "Risk Control Programs".
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THE FULL COPY NEEDS BEFORE IT CAN MOVE OFF THIS TILE.
//
// `what` and `why` on each category are no longer rendered — the tile carries
// NAME and TERM only. They are still in the catalog, unused, waiting for a Risk
// Control department page. For the next commit to be a MOVE rather than a
// rewrite, that page needs:
//
//   1. A ROUTE AND A TAB. DepartmentsPage exists and is already in the tab list
//      every driver walks; a Risk Control section under it needs no new tab and
//      no change to solo-oracle's TABS array. A NEW top-level tab would change
//      that array in four drivers and move every tab-count assertion.
//   2. NOTHING ELSE FROM THIS FILE. The catalog is already the single source —
//      `what`, `why`, `status`, commitmentLabel() and benefitLabel() are all
//      exported and all currently unused by this component. The department page
//      imports the same array and renders the fields this tile drops.
//   3. A DECISION ABOUT `benefitLabel`. It is the one piece of copy that is
//      arguably a tile concern rather than a department one; it is dropped here
//      because "Benefit ramps over years 1-3" does not fit a compact tile, not
//      because it belongs on another page.
//
// So the move is: render `what`, `why` and benefitLabel() on the department
// page, and delete nothing from the catalog.

// ⚠ THREE TILES ARE BUTTONS AND TWO ARE STILL DIVS, AND THE SPLIT IS THE POINT.
// The header above says an inert button is a lie about interactivity. That
// argument has not changed — it has simply stopped applying to the two programs
// that are BUYABLE (GL's analytics and WC's safety & return-to-work; each shows
// only in a pool writing its line) — and now to a third, the claims management
// system, which is POOL-SCOPED and therefore shows in every pool including a
// one-line one. The other two stay divs because they still do nothing; the
// moment one has a standing and a charge it becomes a button by the same rule.
//
// ⚠ "Safety & Return-to-Work" was checked against the drivers' button queries
// the way "Law Enforcement Analytics" was: none is unanchored on a string it
// contains — /Workers' Compensation|General Liability|^Property$/, /Lock Year/,
// /Start/i, /Decline/i, 'Start Simulation'.
//
// ⚠ THE ACCESSIBLE NAME IS THE PROGRAM'S TILE NAME AND NOTHING ELSE, which is
// what keeps it out of the drivers' way. Two session drivers query this page by
// button name; the names they use are 'Decisions', the line labels (anchored
// /^Property$/) and /Lock Year/. "Law Enforcement Analytics" collides with none
// of them, and the four names that might have — 'Property Mitigation' above all
// — are the four that are still divs.
