// ============================================================================
// THE DECISION-PAGE DERIVATIONS — one implementation, two callers.
//
// ⚠ THIS MOVED OUT OF App.tsx UNCHANGED. Every memo below is the one that stood
// in App.tsx, with the same body and the same dependency array; only the file
// changed. A derivation moving files is not a derivation changing, and the solo
// game's rendered output is fingerprinted tab by tab before and after to hold
// that claim to something.
//
// ⚠ WHY IT MOVED RATHER THAN BEING REPRODUCED. A session player plays the same
// game as a solo player, so it needs the same thirteen props — the
// funding-consequence panel, the tower priced off the enrolled book, the
// renewal decline counts, the appetite applicant pool. A second copy of this
// arithmetic is how two paths disagree later, and this repository has
// RESULT_METRICS on record as the case where exactly that happened, twice: the
// on-screen table and the .xlsx export drifted apart because each carried its
// own list. One file, both callers, no second opinion.
//
// ⚠ IT DEPENDS ON NOTHING App HAS AND A SESSION DOES NOT. Every value here is a
// pure function of (gameState, lineView, currentDecisions). There is no context,
// no module state, and nothing reaching back into App — which is what makes the
// session caller a caller rather than a fork.
