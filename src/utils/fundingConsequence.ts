// Funding-confidence-level consequence panel — CLF-only pricing.
//
// ⚠ THE PRICE ITSELF IS NOT COMPUTED HERE ANY MORE. Every rate below comes from
// quoteLineRates in utils/linePricing.ts — the SAME function simulationEngine
// calls to build its own pre-movement quote. That is a structural guarantee,
// not a claim: there is one definition and both callers use it.
//
// WHY THAT CHANGED. This file used to re-derive the stack from its own
// formulas, and the header here asserted it matched the engine. It did not, on
// two counts, and both were invisible because the panel's combined ratio was
// internally consistent on its own basis and read 100.0% — the same 100.0% the
// engine reached once ITS combined-ratio basis was fixed. The two agreed on the
// only summary number anyone would check while the components underneath were:
//
//   GL pool premium rate /$100    panel $5.63 (gross x CLF)   engine $3.26 (net)
//   GL reinsurance rate /$100     panel legacy % of premium   engine runtime tower
//
// A third divergence was found while fixing those two and is worth naming
// separately, because nothing in the brief pointed at it: the panel priced off
// lineState.purePremiumPer100, which is LAST year's. WC and GL re-derive theirs
// from held constants times the current year's trends, so the panel was also a
// year stale (~2%/yr on WC) before any of the above. It now calls
// currentPurePremiumPer100, the engine's own derivation.
//
// WHAT REMAINS DIFFERENT, stated rather than papered over: this is the
// PRE-MOVEMENT quote. The engine's FINAL premium re-runs the same arithmetic on
// the POST-movement book, so the two differ by whoever joins or leaves during
// the year — which the panel cannot know when the decision is being made. The
// engine's own pre-movement estimate is the referent, and parity against it is
// exact. See scripts/diagnostics/panel-engine-parity-check.ts, which asserts
// the components bit-for-bit and MEASURES the post-movement residual instead of
// pretending it is zero.

// unconditionally for every line, while simulationEngine.ts priced WC (and now
// GL) off their own derived distributions — silently showing the player a
// FUNDING_CLF_TABLE-based load/margin/crossing for a line the engine was not
// actually pricing that way. Already ~22-27% off at the 90% confidence
// setting for WC before GL's grid existed to double the problem: GL's own
// curve runs 2-9x WIDER than the generic table (glClfGrid.ts), so the same
// unconditional call would have understated GL's true load severely at any
// confidence level above the crossing. Shipping GL's grid while the panel
// explaining GL's price read a different curve would have been the same

// pure premium at a funding choice without writing a second load. The paragraph
// above is the reason: a panel reading a different curve from the one the engine
// charges is a defect this file already carries the scar of, and the memo is a

// so even though computeFundingConsequence's no longer can. The retired grids
// computed a per-book crossing because they interpolated on the book's own
// CV/lambda; the static tables are one curve per line, so the crossing is one
// number per line — WC 48.8%, GL 57.7% as currently measured (GL reads its

// derived one now crosses at 65.7%, down from 70.9%).
