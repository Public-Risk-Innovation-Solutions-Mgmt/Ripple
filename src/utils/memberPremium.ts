// ============================================================================
// MEMBER-LEVEL PREMIUM ALLOCATION — WHAT EACH MEMBER'S SHARE OF THE LINE'S
// POOL PREMIUM IS, AT THEIR OWN CLASS RATE.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS THE FIRST PER-MEMBER PREMIUM IN THE MODEL. Before it, premium
// existed only as a line-level total — `poolPremium = activeExposure x
// rateAtConfidenceLevelPer100 x 10_000` — and no member was ever individually
// billed. So this introduces an allocation rather than modifying one, which is
// why nothing downstream can move when it lands.
//
// ============================================================================
// ALLOCATE, DO NOT RECOMPUTE — AND THE OBVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION IS THE ONE THAT
// BREAKS THE PROPERTY IT IS MEANT TO GUARANTEE.
//
// The blend is exposure-weighted, so in REAL arithmetic
//     sum_i(e_i . r_i)  ===  blend . sum_i(e_i)
// by the definition of `wcBlendedRatePer100`. It is not true in FLOATING POINT.
// Measured on the shipped roster at three book sizes:
//
//   members   pool from blend        from member sum        difference
//      40     $9,093,305.531494      $9,093,305.531494      1.863e-9
//      60     $13,335,144.892432     $13,335,144.892432     3.725e-9
//      80     $22,950,898.903706     $22,950,898.903706     7.451e-9
//
// About one ulp, and it GROWS WITH THE BOOK. That is comfortably enough for
// value-identity-check to fire — it caught 325 values at ~1e-12 at cc9d8ac and
// was right to.
//
// So the pool total is never recomputed here. It is passed in, already
// computed exactly as it was before this file existed, and split by WEIGHTS:
//
//     share_i = poolPremium . (e_i . r_i) / sum_j(e_j . r_j)
//
// Bit-identity of the pool total then holds BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by
// float luck, because the total is not on the arithmetic path at all. The
// weights need only sum to one, and any error in them redistributes BETWEEN
// members instead of changing what the pool collects.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY WC HAS FOUR RATES AND THE OTHER TWO HAVE ONE, AND IT IS NOT AN OMISSION.
//
// Expected loss per $100 at neutral risk quality, by member type — measured
// over the shipped 200-member catalog:
//
//   WC         schools 1.3201 / county 2.9527 / lowSafety 4.0561 /
//              highSafety 5.8757, against a 3.7391 blend.  SPREAD 4.45x,
//              and the CV WITHIN each rating group is EXACTLY 0.0%.
//   GL         every one of the nine member types reads 5.6319.  SPREAD 1.00x.
//   Property   every one of the nine member types reads 0.2100 (was 0.1915
//              buildings-only, 0.0962 originally).  SPREAD 1.00x.
//
// So WC's four rates fully describe its class structure — nothing is left
// inside a group — while GL and Property have no class structure to describe.
// A class rate on either would have to be INVENTED rather than derived, which
// is a loss-model change and not a pricing one. Both therefore take the flat
// branch below, and that branch is the degenerate case of the same formula
// rather than a special case of the code: with r_i constant, the weights
// collapse to exposure share exactly.

   * ⚠ AND THE RELATIVITY COLUMN DELIBERATELY INCLUDES IT. `relativity` is
   * what the member is charged per unit of exposure against the book's mean,
   * so a member with a favourable mod IS cheaper per $100 and the column
   * should say so. It stops being a pure class relativity the moment the mod

   * now runs against an explicitly unmodified allocation.
