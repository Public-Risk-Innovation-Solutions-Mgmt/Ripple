  // ONE.
  //
  // This read `w = 1 / (i + 1)`, normalised — a decreasing sequence chosen
  // because older cohorts should hold less, which is true and is the only thing
  // it was ever justified by. Combined with `netUltimate = netUnpaid / (1 -
  // paidRatio)` below, it made the seed book's IMPLIED ACCIDENT-YEAR ULTIMATES
  // arbitrary: measured across seeds at generation, the largest was 2.10x the
  // smallest on WC and 2.91x on Property. The pool was implicitly written as
  // having underwritten $0.49M one year and $1.43M four years later, for no
  // reason at all.
  //
  // A pool in equilibrium holds one accident year at each age, each having had
  // roughly the same ultimate U, so the unpaid at age a is U x unpaidShare(a).
  // Taking the weights from the pattern makes that true by construction — and
  // the back-derivation below then returns the SAME U for every cohort, because
  // (U x unpaidShare(a)) / (1 - cumulativePaid(a)) is U identically. The
  // division stops inventing an ultimate and starts recovering the one the
  // weights already implied.
  //
  // ⚠ IT IS FEWER LINES THAN WHAT IT REPLACES, and that is the argument for
  // doing it now rather than as part of a larger change. It deletes a parameter
  // instead of adding one.
  //
  // ⚠ AND IT IS THE SMALLER STEP TOWARD RETIRING SEEDS ALTOGETHER. The end state
  // is a pre-game deep enough that every cohort has a real claim register, and
  // what that produces directly is a per-accident-year ULTIMATE. `U =
  // drawnReserve / sum(unpaidShare(a))` is the analytic stand-in for exactly
  // that quantity, so when the deep pre-game lands this function deletes and
  // nothing downstream changes.
  //
  // ⚠ THE DEEP PRE-GAME HAS LANDED AND THAT CLAIM WAS TESTED RATHER THAN TAKEN.
  // MATURATION_YEARS gives every line ten engine-born accident years with real
  // registers, and this function now seeds only the bootstrap that sits ten years
  // BEFORE the opening. Measured at game start, the cohorts it produces carry
  // 3.12% of WC's opening net reserve and 0.00% of GL's and Property's. So the
  // claim is right on two lines and nearly right on the third, and it is NOT yet
  // exactly right — deleting this function today would move WC's opening by
  // about three per cent of its reserve, which is a re-solve of the pin, not a
  // no-op. It stays until someone wants that re-solve.
  //
  // ⚠ AND seedWeight / seedPaidRatio ARE NOT ORPHANED BY THAT, for now. They
  // exist to keep value-identity-check's legacy geometric control alive (see
  // payoutPattern.ts), and they die with this function rather than before it. The 1/(i+1) weights were a stand-in for nothing
  // and would simply have been thrown away.
  //
  // ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: make a seed indistinguishable from an old game-born
  // cohort. A seed still has no `developingClaims`, so its development is
  // retained entire and never cedes; its `registerSum` is its ultimate rather
  // than a real register sum; its `bookingBias` is zero. The claim register is
  // the whole remaining difference and it is precisely what the deep pre-game
  // supplies. This closes the apportionment half only.
  //
  // NO RNG IS CONSUMED HERE — the weights are deterministic given the pattern,
  // as they were given 1/(i+1) — so the stream position is unchanged and the
  // null test still reads. The geometric control keeps the old weights; see
  // seedWeight, which explains why that is the fourth and last.
