//
// Draws ONE loss amount per claim from a per-rating-group lognormal mixture.
// Replaces the four-tier structure (medical-only / temporary / permanent /
// catastrophic plus a separate presumption process) whose parameters were
// authored as priors and then fitted to each other.
//
// ⚠ "then a REPORT LAG" STOOD HERE AND THE LAG IS GONE (reportLag deleted
// wholesale — see defaultAssumptions.ts:403). Nothing is drawn after the
// amount. This sentence is what made point 4's lag framing below read as
// coherent, so it is corrected in the same pass rather than left to be
// rediscovered.
//
// FOUR INVARIANTS THIS MODULE EXISTS TO HOLD
//
// 1. ONE BASIS FOR LOSSES AND PRICING (finding 6). generateWcClaims (the draw)
//    and the expectation below are written as a matched pair over the same
//    factors — same group rates, same theta, same mixture weights, same
//    component means. (Region multipliers were on that list until region left
//    chronic severity; they are shock-only now.) The expectation differs from the
//    draw ONLY by taking E[member noise] = 1 and using analytic component
//    means. WC's purePremiumPer100 is derived from the expectation, so premium
//    and losses cannot drift onto different bases. Change a factor in one and
//    you must change it in the other.
//
// 2. TWO CHANNELS ARE DRAW-ONLY (finding 17). riskControlEffectiveness AND the
//    risk-quality SEVERITY TILT multiply the draw and are ABSENT from the
//    pricing expectation. Applying either to both sides would move premium and
//    losses together and cancel — exactly the no-op finding 17 identified for
//    loss trend. Keeping them one-sided is what makes risk control and risk
//    quality genuinely move the loss ratio.
//
//    The WC RISK CONTROL PROGRAM's two levers — programFreqMultiplier and
//    programRtwConversion — are draw-only for the same reason, and are absent
//    from k_line too: they are the pool's purchase, not the book's mix.
//
//    ⚠ THE TILT IS NOT ABSENT FROM k_line. k_line's job is to normalise the
//    book's risk-quality MIX, so it must see every channel RQ acts on or the
//    held pure premium drifts as the roster changes. That is why there are TWO
//    named expectation wrappers below rather than one function with a boolean.
//
// 3. PURE PREMIUM IS HELD, k_line ADAPTS. The pick is derived once from the
//    neutral book (deriveNeutralPurePremiumPer100) and does not track the
//    roster; computeKLine does the per-year risk-quality-mix correction. Both
//    tracking enrolment would double-correct.
//
// 4. DOLLAR VINTAGE IS THE ACCIDENT YEAR, ONCE. Severity IS trended, to the
//    accident year at the draw, and frozen onto the claim. WC has NO REPORT
//    LAG — every claim reports in its own accident year — so there is no
//    emergence to re-value and no lag for the trend to compound over.
//
//    ⚠ THIS POINT USED TO READ "Severity carries no trend at all in this
//    model", AND THAT WAS FALSE FROM THE COMMIT THAT ADDED wcSeverityTrend.
//    The trend is defined sixty lines below, applied through trendedMu, and is
//    what carries WC_SEVERITY_CAP from $85M in year 1 to $117.6M by year 10
//    (cb00971). The CONCLUSION was right and its stated REASON was not, and the
//    reason is the part that got copied: the false sentence propagated into
//    WORKING_PRACTICES and PROJECT_STATE_SUMMARY and had to be corrected twice
//    downstream (3da9ebb, 9fc6532) while this line still said it.
//
//    WHAT IS ABSENT IS A LAG, NOT A TREND. The two are separate facts and
//    collapsing them is what made this wrong:
//        (1 + r)^L         L a DRAWN lag           — divergent, needs a bound
//        (1 + r)^(year-1)  year a bounded integer  — deterministic and finite
//    WC trends through the second form only. Trending severity over a lag
//    instead would make E[(1 + r)^lag] over an unbounded lognormal DIVERGENT,
//    not merely large, which is precisely why the retired presumption process
//    had to bound its lag at 40 years. That hazard is real and is why no lag
//    may be reintroduced without the bound and the matching truncated density
//    in the analytic — see WORKING_PRACTICES' truncate-and-renormalize rule.
//    The severity fit itself stays exactly as fitted.

// left inside a group for a fifth rate to catch. That 0.0% is also what makes
// "actual over expected at manual" exactly class-normalising on this line.
//
// ⚠ AND THE REDISTRIBUTION IS LARGE. A school district's WC bill falls to 35%
// of what it paid under the blend; a fire district's rises to 157%. Nothing
// about the pool's total changes — the blend is exposure-weighted, so the
// allocation moves between members and not into or out of the pool.
//
// ⚠ GL AND PROPERTY STAY FLAT, AND THE NEXT READER SHOULD NOT "FINISH THE JOB".
// There is no job. Measured on the same basis, expected loss per $100 at
// neutral RQ by member type: every one of GL's nine types reads 5.6319 and
// every one of Property's reads 0.2100 (was 0.1915 buildings-only, 0.0962
// originally) — SPREAD 1.00x on both, CV 0.0% within
// every category. GL is flat by an explicit decision (GL_LOSS_MODEL's note,
// and GL_RELATIVITIES retired by name) and Property is TIV-proportional. A
// class rate on either would have to be INVENTED rather than derived, which is
// a change to the LOSS MODEL and not to pricing. Put the differential in the
// generator first or leave both alone.
// ============================================================================
//
// ⚠ THIS IS NOT A SECOND WAY TO PRICE, IT IS THE SAME PRICE STOPPED ONE STEP
// EARLIER. The blended rate IS the payroll-weighted average of these four over
// the full roster — reproduced to 1.3e-15 — so nothing has been re-fitted or
// re-calibrated. What changes is that the blend is taken over the ENROLLED book
// rather than over the roster, so a pool that is unusually schools-heavy pays a
// schools-heavy price instead of the market's average price.
//
// ⚠ FOUR RATES ARE EXACT ONLY BECAUSE REGION LEFT SEVERITY, and that ordering is
// why this was worth two commits. While region multiplied severity, two members
// of the same rating group in different regions had different loss costs, so a
// group's expectation was not proportional to its payroll and four rates left a
// -0.34% composition residual. With region gone a rating group is genuinely
