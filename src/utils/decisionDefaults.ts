     *
     * Declining an EXISTING member by default would be an underwriting decision
     * nobody took — the pool would be throwing members out on its own
     * initiative. Writing a NEW member by default is the same kind of thing in
     * the other direction: the pool would be growing itself while the player
     * watched, and every consequence of that growth — the rate falling as fixed
     * costs spread, the reserve building, the book drifting away from the one
     * the game opened with — would arrive unattributed.
     *
     * The asymmetry is that renewal's default keeps the book AS IT IS and
     * intake's default — the slider at 0 — does too. Both defaults are "change nothing". They
     * only look opposite because one control acts by omission and the other by
     * commission.
     *
     * ⚠ WITH BOTH AT THEIR DEFAULTS THE BOOK IS FROZEN FOR THE WHOLE GAME, and
     * that is the intended reading rather than a side effect. Voluntary
     * departures are off (VOLUNTARY_DEPARTURES_ENABLED), Renew All declines
     * nobody, and No New Business writes nobody — so a player who touches
     * nothing plays the pool they were given. Every membership change in a
     * played game is now traceable to a decision somebody made.
     *
     * ⚠ AND IT DOES NOT REACH THE PRE-GAME, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SAFE TO SET.
     * The pre-game runs at these same defaults, so before the roster was frozen
     * STRUCTURALLY this would have changed the opening book — exactly the
     * coupling LineYearContext.freezeMembership removes. Verified rather than
     * assumed: the year-1 book is unchanged member for member across this
     * change.
