// WC's OWN loss-distribution shape, replacing the shared FUNDING_CLF_TABLE for
// WC pricing (finding 38). GL and Property are untouched — see the header on
// src/data/wcClfGrid.ts for why, and for the process-risk-only caveat that
// governs this whole module (do not "correct" any of it toward
// FUNDING_CLF_TABLE's numbers — the two measure different phenomena).
//
// TWO PARTS:
//   1. wcAggregateCumulants — the analytic mean and CV of the aggregate
//      annual gross loss, for a given enrolled book. VERIFIED against Monte
//      Carlo at three book sizes (mean and CV both landed inside the MC 95%
//      CI); this is what the grid interpolation below is indexed on.
//   2. computeWcClf — the percentile lookup itself. A first attempt used a
//      Cornish-Fisher expansion off this module's own skewness/kurtosis, and
//      it failed: WC's skewness (18-42, driven by the deliberately
//      heavy-tailed `large` severity component) is far outside where a
//      cumulant-polynomial correction to the normal quantile is valid, and it
//      produced NEGATIVE loss percentiles. computeWcClf now interpolates a
//      Monte Carlo percentile GRID (src/data/wcClfGrid.ts) on the book's own
//      CV instead — no closed form, no failure mode, and monotonic by
//      construction (interpolating two monotonic curves at matched
//      percentile stops stays monotonic).
//
// ⚠ MEMBERS ARE NO LONGER INDEPENDENT, AND THE DERIVATION BELOW IS NOW THE
// CONDITIONAL ONE. It opened "the aggregate loss for a book of enrolled members
// is a SUM OF INDEPENDENT MEMBER PROCESSES", which was true until
// WC_LOSS_MODEL.wcYearFactor shipped: one shared Gamma draw now multiplies every
// member's arrival rate, so members are independent GIVEN that factor and
// correlated without it. Everything below is correct conditional on g, and
// wcAggregateCumulants mixes over g at the end — read the two together. The
// mixing touches the VARIANCE only; the mean is untouched because E[g] = 1.
//
// THE CUMULANT DERIVATION (mean/CV), for the record: conditional on the year
// factor the aggregate loss for a book of enrolled members is a sum of
// independent member processes, so its cumulants are the SUM of each member's
// own cumulants (cumulants are additive under independent summation). Each
// member's own process is a
// Gamma-mixed compound Poisson: a Poisson count PER SEVERITY COMPONENT,
// jointly thinned by memberFrequencyNoise (Gamma(shape=16, mean=1),
// multiplying every component's rate for that member SIMULTANEOUSLY — a
// bad-frequency-year member draws more of everything, not one component in
// isolation), with severity drawn from that component's lognormal. Its
// cumulant generating function is
//   K(t) = -alpha * ln(1 - C(t)/alpha),  C(t) = Lambda_member * (M_severity(t) - 1)
// where C(t)'s Taylor coefficients (c_1..c_4) are Lambda_member x the RAW
// MOMENTS of severity (the standard compound-Poisson identity kappa_k =
// lambda x E[X^k]). Expanding K(t) to O(t^4) and reading off kappa_k = k! x
// [t^k] K(t) gives, in terms of that member's own c_1..c_4:
//
//   kappa_1 = c1
//   kappa_2 = c2 + c1^2/alpha
//   kappa_3 = c3 + 3 c1 c2/alpha + 2 c1^3/alpha^2
//   kappa_4 = c4 + 4 c1 c3/alpha + 3 c2^2/alpha + 12 c1^2 c2/alpha^2 + 6 c1^4/alpha^3
//
// As alpha -> infinity this reduces to kappa_k = c_k exactly, the ordinary
// compound-Poisson result. kappa_3/kappa_4 are still computed here (skewness,
// excessKurtosis on WcAggregateCumulants) because they were part of the
// verified derivation and cost nothing extra to expose — they are simply not
// fed into a Cornish-Fisher expansion any more.
