// ONE MAPPING FROM A LINE-YEAR'S INPUTS TO ITS GENERATOR CALL.
//
// ⚠ THIS EXISTS SO THE ENGINE AND THE REGENERATOR CANNOT DRIFT. processYear
// draws a year's claims live; claimRegeneration redraws a PAST year on demand
// from what the result persisted. If each built its generator arguments
// separately, the two would be two descriptions of one fact — the shape that
// let the claims workbook's line sheets and its Development sheet disagree about
// which years existed. So the argument-building is here, once, and both call it.
// The engine is NOT calling the regenerator: it has its claims already, and a
// second path producing the same objects is exactly the drift being avoided.
// It is calling the same INPUT mapping the regenerator calls, then running the
// generator itself — for the three ENROLLED draws. The marketplace-prospect
// draws (k = 1, rc = 0, claims discarded) stay inline at their call sites: they
// are not what regeneration reproduces, and rewriting them would be churn on a
// path nothing redraws.
//
// ⚠ NOTHING HERE DRAWS. Every function is pure in its arguments. The randomness
// is inside the three generators, keyed per member on (seed, year, memberId) —
// enrolment-independence-check's guarantee — and in poolYearFactor below, keyed
// on (seed, year). That is what makes a redraw exact rather than approximate.

 *
 * ⚠ THE SHOCK CHANNELS DIFFER BY LINE AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. WC takes
 * component arrival-rate multipliers and injections (explicit, or ranged and
 * region-bound, keyed on the shock id); GL takes
 * whole-line frequency and severity multipliers, injections (explicit or
 * ranged) and gPool; Property takes forced catastrophes, weather events and no gPool (its
 * fitted mixture already contains what gPool would add — see the note at its
 * engine call site). A shock effect the line does not read is dropped here —
 * and shockCatalog now REJECTS such an effect at load, so a catalog event can
 * no longer be dropped silently.
 *
 * ⚠ THESE RETURN INPUTS, NOT RESULTS, and that is deliberate. The engine reads
 * generator outputs the regenerator has no use for — WC's per-component counts
 * and injection attribution, GL's maxOccurrenceGross — so a shared function
 * that RAN the generator would have to return every line's full result type.
 * Sharing the argument construction and letting each caller run the generator
 * itself keeps one mapping without forcing one output shape.
