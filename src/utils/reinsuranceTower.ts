// runtime-computed aggregate stop-loss price.
//
// Pure and side-effect free. Nothing here draws randomness — the layering is a
// deterministic function of occurrence totals, and the aggregate price is a
// deterministic function of the selection and the exposure.
//
// EROSION FALLS OUT OF THE ARITHMETIC — no mechanic, and none is needed.
// cedeToLayer is independent per layer and per occurrence, so:
//   - a DECLINED layer is retained automatically; nothing has to model that
//   - a CORRIDOR RETENTION (buying $15M xs $10M while declining $5M xs $5M) needs
//     no special case: the middle band simply is not ceded
//   - a large occurrence "erodes through" a retained corridor before reaching a
//     purchased upper layer, purely from the min/max
// The one thing that does NOT fall out is reinstatements, because there is no
// annual limit to reinstate — see the simplification note in reinsuranceTower.ts.

//
// ============================================================================
// TWO DEFECTS FIXED HERE, AND THE SECOND ONE IS NOT A TREND PROBLEM.
//
// 1. THE STORED SECOND MOMENT WAS FROZEN AT YEAR-1 DOLLARS.
//    WC_RETAINED_SECOND_MOMENT[mask] was measured once and indexed by placement
//    bitmask. Retained loss is a SECOND moment, so it grows roughly as trend^2 —
//    the stored table understated SD[R] by more every year, making the aggregate
//    progressively cheaper in real terms exactly as the risk it covers grew.
//    Now computed from retainedRiskMoments, which integrates the piecewise-linear
//    retained function band by band in closed form at the current year.
//
// 2. lambda WAS ON THE WRONG EXPOSURE BASIS — independent of trend, and it would
//    have survived any re-measurement of the table.
//    The old line was `lambda = AGG_OCC_FREQ_PER_1M x exposureMillions`, where
//    exposureMillions is NOMINAL (wage-inflated) exposure. But WC's occurrence
//    COUNT tracks REAL (frozen) payroll x wcFrequencyTrend — payroll growth here
//    is pure wage inflation, and letting claim counts rise with it would assert
//    that paying people more injures more of them (the exact defect lineHelpers'
//    getMemberExposure header warns about, and finding 37's class). So modelled
//    lambda grew at 3.63%/yr while true lambda grew at the frequency trend.
//    Worse, E[R] was derived from the correctly-trended expectedGrossLoss while
//    SD[R] came from this incorrectly-trended lambda, so the CV fed to the
//    lognormal was wrong in a way NEITHER INPUT REVEALED ALONE.
//    retainedRiskMoments reads each member's real payroll and the line's own
//    wcFrequencyTrend, so there is no separate frequency constant to be on the
//    wrong basis.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED: E[R] is still derived as
// (expectedGrossLoss - ceded by the placed layers) rather than taken from
// retainedRiskMoments directly. That keeps the existing "the two cannot drift"
// property — E[R] and the layer prices come from one arithmetic — and keeps E[R]
// on the engine's own actual-risk-quality basis. Only the CV comes from the
// neutral-RQ moment machinery, because a RATIO is far less basis-sensitive than
// either moment alone: the neutral and actual bases differ by a few percent on
// each moment and by very little on their quotient.
//
// AGG_OVERDISPERSION IS GONE. It was a 1.05 fudge back-solved to widen a pure
// -Poisson SD into the measured one, compensating for per-member Gamma frequency
// noise that the stored table could not represent. retainedRiskMoments carries
// that noise analytically (the B2 term), so multiplying by 1.05 on top would now
// double-count it.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ `termsRetained` — THE TOWER IS AGREED IN ADVANCE, AND THAT IS A CONTRACT
// FACT BEFORE IT IS A NUMERICAL ONE.
//
// The attachment and the limit are the TREATY. They are negotiated before the
// year on figures already in hand, and they do not move again. Everything else
// this function computes — E[R], SD[R], the ceded expectation, the premium — is
// the pool's CURRENT view of the loss it is buying cover against, and that view
// is allowed to move.
//
// Default (`undefined`) keeps the terms on `expectedRetained`, which is derived
// from the caller's `expectedGrossLoss`. On the HELD pricing path that is not
// circular: the held rate is a constant in hand before the year, so terms set
// from it are terms set in advance. Every held-path call passes nothing here and
// gets bit-identical arithmetic to what this function always did.
//
// It is supplied on the EXPERIENCE path, where the rate is being SOLVED. There
// the gross rate is the unknown of `grossUpRetainedPurePremium`'s root-find, and
// letting the attachment ride on it makes the treaty re-price itself while the
// rate is being calculated. That is a modelling artefact with a measured
// consequence: with the $1M attachment rounding at propertyAggregate.ts:270,
// ceded(g) becomes a SAWTOOTH — rising at about +0.72 within a tooth, dropping
// ~0.0024 whenever the rounded attachment steps a million — so
// h(g) = g - ceded(g) - retained is a rising staircase that steps OVER zero and
// the equation the gross-up solves HAS NO ROOT. Fixing the terms removes the
// drops and leaves the +0.72 slope, so h' is about +0.28 and the root exists and
// is unique. See grossUpRetainedPurePremium's header for the grid this was
// measured on.
//
// ⚠ THE ROUNDING STAYS. It is how attachments are actually written and BIN
// ($25k) was chosen against it. The circularity was the defect; the rounding was
// only where it happened to bite, and a finer lattice would have left the loop
// in place to return on a tower change or a different rate level.

//
// GL passes through untouched. It offers no aggregate — see
// AGG_ATTACHMENT_LEVELS, which has no GL key — so there is nothing to gate,
// and routing it through the condition anyway would assert a rule about a
// product that does not exist.
//
// ⚠ CONDITIONAL, NOT THE LAYER MANDATORY. Declining EVERYTHING stays
// reachable — it is the legitimate self-insured choice and the tower's null
// test depends on it. What is removed is only the aggregate-WITHOUT-layer
// combination.
//
// WHY, and it is structural rather than a balance judgement. The aggregate has
// a LIMIT. With the occurrence layer capping each claim at the retention, no
// single claim can consume the whole limit. Without it, one claim can exceed
// attachment-plus-limit and everything above is retained unconditionally with
// no second backstop. Measured over six arms x 50 games on test/pr-aggregate,
// aggregate-only is a TRAP rather than a tradeoff: it looks better on both
// figures a player can see — cost/recovery 2.060x against occurrence-only's
// 2.885x, mean underwriting -$1.37M against -$3.93M — while being materially
// worse where they cannot: 9/50 games touching negative surplus against 6/50,
// worst multiple -3.949 against -0.723. Seed 00CT5DKA goes 0.979 to -3.949 on
// exactly one uncapped claim.
//
// And it is not a product a reinsurer writes. An aggregate over an uncapped
// per-occurrence retention is a stop-loss on GROSS severity, which is a
// different treaty from the one quoteAggregate prices.
//
// WC IS THE WORSE CASE OF THE TWO, and it was gated one commit after Property
// so that commit's line control stayed clean. Measured: with all three layers
// declined WC's aggregate attaches at $19.17M with a $17.42M limit, so it tops
// out at $36.59M, against a WC ceiling of $85M in year 1. This read "and WC
// severity is UNBOUNDED... Property's ungated worst case is at least FINITE;
// WC's is not" before that cap existed. Both worst cases are finite now — WC's
// year-1 gap above its ungated aggregate is $85M - $36.59M = $48.4M against
// Property's $75M - $28.75M = $46.3M — so the gate's justification is now a
// comparison of two bounded exposures rather than bounded against unbounded. It
// is the same gate for the same reason; only the sharpness of the contrast
// changed. ⚠ THE WC FIGURE IS YEAR-1: wcSeverityCap trends and the aggregate's
// attachment does not, so WC's gap widens to $117.6M - $36.59M = $81.0M by year
// 10 while Property's holds at $46.3M. The contrast sharpens again with time,
// which strengthens this gate rather than weakening it. WC's measured tail carries a 1-in-250-year claim at $71.2M and
// a $248.84M claim observed in 1,000 game-years. Ungated, that $248M claim
// leaves the pool retaining $231M against an opening surplus near $11M — the
// aggregate's limit is consumed by a fraction of one claim and there is no
// bound on what sits above it.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT CLOSE. Only the all-declined case. With
// EVERYTHING purchased WC's tower reaches $50M and the pool still retains
// above that without limit, because the severity cap is what is missing, not
// the cover. That is a severity-cap question and deliberately not answered
// here; scripts/diagnostics/wc-above-tower-report.ts measures what the band
