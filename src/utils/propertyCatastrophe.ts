// PROPERTY'S CATASTROPHE BAND — the EXACT event-loss distribution, and every
// price that reads it.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS IS EXACT, AND WHY THAT IS A REQUIREMENT RATHER THAN A NICETY.
//
// PROPERTY_CAT_MODEL fixes each member's loss when hit, so a member is a
// two-point variable {0 w.p. 1-f, L_i w.p. f}, and one event's gross loss is:
//
//   pick a region r with probability w_r, then sum r's members' two-point draws
//
// Its distribution is therefore a MIXTURE over three regions of a CONVOLUTION
// of two-point distributions — no sampling needed, and none is done. Built
// that way it is bit-reproducible: the same book gives the same array to the
// last bit on every call, which every baseline in this project asserts.
//
// The sampled alternative was measured and rejected. At 400,000 event draws its
// far tail was ~30% light at two different seeds (P(event retained > $150M)),
// which priced the remote aggregate stop ~5% cheap; a 4,000,000-draw run
// converged onto THIS construction within 2 SE at every threshold. And a
// sampled price depends on a seed and on how many draws precede it, so any
// upstream change would move every baseline — the failure class the
// per-member stream keying was introduced to end.
//
// ⚠ ONE APPROXIMATION REMAINS, AND IT IS MEAN-PRESERVING. A member's L_i does
// not generally fall on the $25k lattice, so it is SPLIT between its two
// bounding lattice points in the proportion that keeps its mean — the same
// construction propertyAggregate's Gerber discretisation uses for the
// attritional severity. E[event gross] on the lattice equals the closed form to
// float precision. The layer's attachment ($5M), the earthquake's deductible
// ($10M) and the top ($1B) are lattice points, so the per-event retained/ceded
// mapping adds no further approximation.
//
// ⚠ MEMBERS ARE CONVOLVED IN A FIXED ORDER — BY id — NOT IN ROSTER ORDER.
// Convolution is commutative in exact arithmetic and not in floating point: a
// roster reordered by an unrelated change would move the last bit of every
// price here. Sorting first makes the array a function of the book's CONTENT.
//
// ⚠ CACHED BY BOOK, NOT BY PLACEMENT. The event distribution depends on the
// enrolled members and the footprint and on nothing the player decides this
// turn — the Decisions panel re-quotes on every render and must not rebuild
// it. The key is the book's content (id, region, loss-if-hit), which is
// stricter than a year key: a year whose book changed mid-turn cannot be served
// a stale distribution.
