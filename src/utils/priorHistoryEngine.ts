// Stage 2.10 + seed-fix-per-line-opening — per-line prior histories.
//
// Each active line gets a REAL simulated 3-year pre-game past (yearNumbers -2,
// -1, 0) produced by the same engine as live years, at default decisions —
// preceded by MATURATION_YEARS further simulated years that are NOT part of the
// declared past and exist only to leave a ten-accident-year book behind. See
// MATURATION_YEARS for why, and for the re-pin that separates the book from the
// profit that built it. Each
// line is simulated IN ISOLATION (a single-line pre-game), so its history is
// config-independent: WC's pre-game is byte-identical whether the game is
// WC-only, WC+GL, or WC+GL+Property. There is no shared roster fold and no
// pool-wide reseed across lines during the pre-game. The per-line ending states
// are then assembled into the Year 1 opening pool; live years (Y1+) resume the
// normal multi-line shared-cash fold, which reproduces each line's stored
// surplus (so tie-out holds with cash still pooled).
//
// Seeding: every engine draw is deriveSubRng(seed, yearNumber, label), a pure
// stateless function; each line's streams are label-keyed to that line, so a
// line at attempt 0 uses the true instance seed and is unaffected by whether
// other lines exist or needed a redraw.
//
// Opening band (PER-LINE reject-and-redraw, NO clamping): each active line
// must end its pre-game with opening surplus inside that line's own
// OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND — [min, max] × its own opening POOL PREMIUM on a
// 'premium' line, or × its own opening NET RESERVE on a 'reserve' line
// (two-sided: too weak AND too strong both redraw). If a line lands outside,
// ONLY that line re-simulates on a deterministically derived alternate seed
// (seed + attempt * 997) until it lands in-band — one line's redraw never
// reseeds another. Deterministic: same seed -> same per-line redraw path
// -> same history, every config. The accepted history is real and ties out.

// ============================================================================
// THE MATURATION YEARS — WHY THE POOL NO LONGER STARTS THREE YEARS OLD.
//
// These are played BEFORE the three declared pre-game years and are not part of
// the pool's stated past. Their only job is to leave a book behind: ten accident
// years, each at its own age, each with a real claim register, a real developing
// set and real cession — the thing a three-year pre-game plus a handful of
// apportioned seed cohorts cannot produce.
//
// ⚠ WHY IT WAS NEEDED, AND IT IS A FORWARD-BOOKING PROBLEM. Booking a cohort at
// its contracted initial estimate understates incurred while the book is young.
// A pool in runoff EQUILIBRIUM does not have that problem: the development of
// its older years exactly offsets the under-booking of its newest, so booked
// incurred equals ultimate written. A three-year book is nowhere near
// equilibrium, so three years of income were overstated and the opening surplus
// ran away with them — measured, the unfiltered opening median rose to 2.207 on
// WC against a band ceiling of 1.22, and no admissible pin brought it back:
// WC and GL both solved NEGATIVE and both sat above their ceilings at K = 0.
//
// ⚠ THE TRANSIENT IS AS LONG AS THE IBNER HORIZON, WHICH IS WHERE TEN COMES
// FROM. Measured, the implied intercept by depth:
//
//   accident years at game start        WC       GL   Property
//   3 (the old book)                  1.304    1.628     0.395
//   7                                 0.783    0.064    -0.265
//   10  <- shipped                    0.377   -0.012    -0.105
//   13                                0.237   -0.048    -0.131
//
// Each line stops improving at roughly its own MEAN IBNER horizon — GL (5.5)
// and Property (3) are done by seven, WC (8.5) is still moving at thirteen.
// Nobody designed that agreement; it is the reason to trust the number. Seven
// passes on all three lines but leaves WC at K* = 0.112, which is thin. Ten is
// set by WC and is where WC has room.
//
// ⚠ AND THE RELIEF IS DEVELOPMENT, NOT RESERVE — WHICH IS WHY THE BOOK HAS TO BE
// PLAYED RATHER THAN APPORTIONED. Split at the boundary below, the whole move is
// made in the three declared years and it is adverse development on the mature
// book: 108% of it on every line, with investment income on the assets backing
// the deeper reserve pushing the other way (hence over 100%). GL is the proof —
// its net reserve/premium rises only 1.118 -> 1.429 while its opening falls by
// 1.585 of premium, five times more. The relief is a FLOW of development across
// ten cohorts, not a STOCK of reserve. An apportioned book carries the stock and
// none of the flow, so it would have bought nothing.
//
// ⚠ AND CESSION IS REAL HERE, WHICH AN APPORTIONED BOOK CANNOT MODEL. A seed
// cohort has no register, so it cedes nothing ever. These cohorts cede: the
// tower takes 15% / 26% / 14% off the standing reserve, and the gain survives it.
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ WHAT IT COSTS, AND THE TWO COSTS ARE DIFFERENT AUDIENCES.
//
// THE PLAYER pays 261 ms for a full three-line opening, measured at the
// re-solved pin with the band in force and no fallbacks in 20 openings. That is
// 2.6x the old path rather than the 3.3x the depth alone implies, because a
// centred pin buys back more than the extra years cost: fifty precomputed
// openings take 13 s, and a cold start that generates one takes 0.26 s.
//
// THE DEVELOPER pays much more, on the two-armed gates only, and this is the
// real bill. The pin is ONE SCALAR PER LINE and it centres the SHIPPED
// configuration. Any gate that also runs the other arm through runPriorHistory
// runs it off-centre, and the deeper pre-game multiplies every extra attempt.
// Measured, share of unfiltered candidates landing in band:
//
//   line       FB on (shipped)   FB off (retired)
//   WC              30%               45%
//   GL              35%                5%     <- 1 in 20, so ~20 attempts
//   Property        20%               25%
//
// GL's retired arm therefore pays roughly twenty ten-year pre-games per opening,
// and cohort-ledger-check went from about 35 s to over ten minutes on that
// alone. It is not fallbacks — nothing hits the 500 cap — it is an off-centre
// proposal distribution meeting a longer candidate.
//
// ⚠ DO NOT FIX THIS BY SHORTENING THE PRE-GAME. The depth is what the mechanism
// needs. If the suite's runtime has to come down, cut GAMES on the two-armed
// gates, or stop running the retired arm through the real search where the arm
// is only being reported — pregame-acceptance-check does the latter and says so.

 * `poolPremiumRatePer100` is worse because the compiler cannot catch it: it is
 * COMPUTED, `poolPremium / (activeExposure x 10_000)`, and both of those fields
 * are real at pool scope — but pool activeExposure is payroll plus TIV, so the
 * quotient is dollars per $100 of two different things added together. The type
 * change finds the placeholder read and cannot find this one; it is omitted here
 * by hand, and that asymmetry is worth knowing about the guard's reach.
