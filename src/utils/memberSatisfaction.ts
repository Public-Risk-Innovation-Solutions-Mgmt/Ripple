// ============================================================================
// MEMBER SATISFACTION — what one member thinks of the pool, and it MOVES.
//
// FOUR LIMBS. ONE CHANGE, THREE LEVELS:
//
//   sat_t = sat_(t-1) + delta_i + PULL . (anchor_i - (sat_(t-1) + delta_i))
//
//   delta_i  = -K . r(excess) . amp_i          the CHANGE, amplified per member
//   anchor_i = CENTRE - A . L(levelGap)        the MARKET's level
//                    + B . lossLevel_i         the MEMBER's own losses  (term 3)
//                    + surplusContribution     the POOL's surplus       (term 4)
//
// ⚠ TERM 3 IS THE ONLY PER-MEMBER CHANNEL, AND BEFORE IT THERE WAS NONE. The
// price gap is line-level — one pricing decision, identical for every member of
// a line-year — so until this limb shipped two members side by side, one with no
// claims and one with four, read the same number. Measured, the whole
// cross-member spread of the displayed value was 0.034 points at year 1, and
// every bit of it came from enrolment history rather than from anything a member
// had done or had happen to them.
//
// ⚠ AND TERMS 1 AND 4 PULL AGAINST EACH OTHER ON THE PLAYER'S MAIN LEVER, WHICH
// IS THE CENTRAL FACT ABOUT THIS MODEL NOW. Funding is what BUILDS surplus: one
// stop up raises the price, which costs satisfaction through the market level,
// and accumulates surplus, which pays it back through term 4. The first two
// weights tried for surplusWeight cancelled 56% and 67% of the funding decision
// and the gate went red on a ruling it has held since the level term shipped.
// See surplusWeight for how the bound replaced the match.
//
// THE FIRST TWO LIMBS, BECAUSE A PRICE HAS TWO THINGS TO SAY:
//
//   THE CHANGE — what happened to the bill this year, once.
//
//     delta_i = -K . r(excess_i)
//     r(x)    = x^2 for x >= 0, -x^2/LAMBDA for x < 0     CONVEX and ASYMMETRIC
//     excess  = the pool's rate change against the market — the member's own
//               modifier is removed AT SOURCE, not damped. See satisfactionMoves.
//
//   THE LEVEL — where the pool's price SITS against the market, every year it
//   persists. It is an ANCHOR the stock decays toward, not a second flow.
//
//     anchor_i = CENTRE - A . L(levelGap)
//     L(x)     = x for x >= 0, x/LAMBDA for x < 0         LINEAR, kinked at 0
//
//   sat_t = sat_(t-1) + delta_i  +  PULL . (anchor_i - (sat_(t-1) + delta_i))
//
// clamped to [1, 10].
//
// ⚠ A LEVEL AS A FLOW WOULD BE UNBOUNDED, WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON FOR THE
// ANCHOR. A change gap happens once and a flow is the right shape for it. A
// standing 10% gap added year after year would only ever be stopped by the
// [1, 10] clamp — and a model whose limit is its clamp is not a model. As an
// anchor the stock walks to what the standing price implies and stays there.
//
// ⚠ AND THE ANCHOR FIXED THE THING THE CONVEX FORM COULD NOT. The stock used to
// be a random walk driven by a convex reaction to a noisy gap, with nothing
// pulling it back, so its defaults drift accumulated. Mean-reverting, the same
// noise is transient: WC's drift went -0.0115 to +0.0073 points per member-year
// and the six-year decision footprint's standard error fell from 0.014 to 0.006.
// The level term is not a second way to wander. It is what stopped the first.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE MEMBER'S OWN EXPERIENCE RATING IS NOT IN THE GAP AT ALL, AND IT TOOK
// TWO COMMITS TO GET THERE BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE DAMPED IT INSTEAD.
//
// Measured on the convex form, WC's gap had SD 7.29pp of which about 5pp was
// mod_t/mod_(t-1) — against 2.81 from the market benchmark and 3.69 from the
// pool's own charged rate. A scoreboard whose largest movement is the member's
// own modifier churning is not reporting on the player. The first attempt
// discounted it out with a weight; this one removes it by comparing the
// member's bill to WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THEIR PREVIOUS MODIFIER, which is
// the pool's rate change and nothing else.
//
// WC's gap SD is 4.52pp against sqrt(2.81^2 + 3.69^2) = 4.64 for the two
// components that should be left — slightly under, because the benchmark and
// the charged rate are not independent (both carry the trend, and both respond
// to the same loss experience through the pool's own triangle). Nothing else is
// in there.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ WHY CONVEX RATHER THAN A BIGGER W, WHICH WAS THE OBVIOUS NEXT STEP.
//
// The linear form's own measurement killed it: gap and noise both scale
// linearly in the weight, so the separation ratio is CONSTANT and raising W
// makes the scoreboard louder and no clearer. The problem was never the size of
// the reaction — it was that a 1.5pp year and a 13pp decision were treated as
// the same kind of thing. A convex reaction fixes that at source rather than
// amplifying it.
//
// What it buys, measured: in a year carrying both a typical gap and one stop on
// the funding slider, the DECISION'S SHARE of the member's move goes from 42%
// under the linear form to 67% under this one. That share is a property of the
// FORM and is the same at any coefficient, which is why it is the number worth
// quoting rather than any absolute size.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS A SHARE, NOT NOISE REMOVAL. The gap's SD at defaults is 5-7pp per
// line while one funding stop is worth about +4pp, so a p90 ordinary year still
// outweighs a decision under either form. Convexity moves the ordinary year out
// of the way; it does not make the benchmark quiet.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THIS IS A BUILD, NOT A REPAIR, AND WHAT IT REPLACES HAD NO MOVING PARTS.
//
// Member.satisfaction was drawn once at enrolment from U(6.0, 8.5) and never
// updated again: measured, it changed in 70 of 18,239 member-year pairs (0.4%),
// and every one of those was a member re-joining and drawing afresh. Its only
// consumer was the old departure key, and the departure rebuild took that out —
// see memberDeparture.ts, which condemns the field as "inert noise wearing a
// behavioural label" and as "a coin flip frozen at enrolment into a permanent
// caste". So for the last several commits it has been a frozen number with no
// reader, displayed on the members table as if it meant something.
//
// THAT IS WHY IT DRIFTED FOR MONTHS UNNOTICED, and it is the argument for
// building it as a MEASURED quantity now rather than waiting for a consumer: a
// field nothing reads and nothing writes is invisible to every gate in the
// repo. This one is written every year by a pure function of things the player
// can see, and member-satisfaction-check asserts that it moves.
//
// ============================================================================
// IT FEEDS NOTHING, AND THAT IS THE RULING RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT.
//
// No DECISION in src/ reads Member.satisfaction. Two display surfaces do —
// MembershipPage's roster column and ResultSpreadsheetPage's, which also has a
// CSV export of it. It is a SCOREBOARD. Both export baselines therefore hold
// bit-identical across this commit, and that is the test of the claim rather
// than a hope: if a baseline moves, something reads the field.
//
// ⚠ THE SECOND SURFACE WAS FOUND BY THE GATE AND NOT BY ME, WHICH IS THE
// ARGUMENT FOR THE GATE BEING STATIC. This header first said "nothing except
// MembershipPage". member-satisfaction-check's allow-list scan named
// ResultSpreadsheetPage on its first run: a per-member Satisfaction column and
// a CSV of it, live since before this rebuild and rendering a frozen number the
// whole time.
//
// ⚠ AND NEITHER BASELINE COVERS THAT CSV. solo-export-guard hashes
// buildResultsWorkbook, which carries no per-member roster, so that page's
// export is a player-facing surface no baseline sees. It is also why both
// baselines can hold bit-identical while the field starts moving — the thing
// that changed is not on either guarded path. Named rather than left to be
// discovered as a "baseline missed it" later.
//
// ⚠ AND THERE ARE NOW TWO SATISFACTION NUMBERS IN THE MODEL. Say it plainly
// because it is a seam and it will be found:
//
//   LinePoolState.memberSatisfaction   a POOL-LEVEL scalar, updated by
//     updateSatisfaction in membershipEngine.ts, which DOES feed retention
//     through MEMBER_MOVEMENT_WEIGHTS.retention.satisfaction. It reads the rate
//     change as a deviation from RATE_NEUTRAL_CHANGE_PCT, plus dividends and
//     assessments. It is not an average of anything.
//
//   Member.satisfaction                this. PER MEMBER, per line, reads the
//     member's OWN bill against the market, and feeds nothing.
//
// They are not two views of one quantity and averaging this one into that one
// is NOT the tidy-up it looks like — it would put a per-member price signal
// into retention, which moves every baseline and every calibration that stands
// on them. Converging them is a measurement commit of its own.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT WOULD HAVE TO BE TRUE FOR THE DEPARTURE MODEL TO READ IT.
//
// This is where the mechanic goes, and the next person should not have to
// reverse-engineer that from a display field — which is exactly how the frozen
// version survived. memberDeparture.ts ranks members by
//
//     risk_i = W_PRICE . max(0, priceShock_i) . marketability_i + noise_i
//
// and satisfaction would enter as a fourth term. Three things have to hold
// first, and none of them holds today:
//
//   1. IT MUST NOT DOUBLE-COUNT priceShock. Departure's priceShock is the
//      pool-wide rate deviation plus the member's own modifier change — which
//      is the SAME two quantities this file's excess_i is built from, minus the
//      market benchmark. Adding satisfaction as written to the risk it is built
//      from would weight one signal twice and call it two mechanisms. The
//      honest form is that satisfaction REPLACES priceShock there (it is the
//      accumulated, market-adjusted version of it) rather than joining it.
//
//   2. IT NEEDS A LEVEL THAT MEANS SOMETHING. A stock on [1, 10] whose starting
//      point is a U(6.0, 8.5) draw has no natural threshold — "below 6" is a
//      statement about the draw, not about the member. Departure needs either a
//      relative reading (this member against this book's median, the way
//      displayedMod handles the same problem) or a calibrated absolute one.
//
//   3. THE DRIFT AT DEFAULTS MUST BE ZERO AND STAY THERE. A scoreboard that
//      drifts a tenth of a point a year is readable; a departure term that does
//      is a slow, invisible retune of the book. member-satisfaction-check
//      asserts the drift at defaults, which is what makes that promotion
//      checkable rather than argued.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT DRIVES IT — TWO THINGS, AND IT WAS THREE.
//
//   THE POOL'S PRICE, against the market. The member's bill is
//   pool rate x class relativity x mod; holding the modifier at LAST YEAR'S
//   value makes the class relativity and the mod both cancel, so the
//   counterfactual bill change is the pool's rate change exactly. That is what
//   the change limb reads, and where the level limb's gap comes from.
//
//     ⚠ THE RAW RATE CHANGE, NOT THE DEVIATION FROM NEUTRAL. Retention and the
//     pool-level satisfaction scalar both read
//     `rateChangePct - RATE_NEUTRAL_CHANGE_PCT[line]`, because they have no
//     other way to say what a normal year looks like. This one subtracts the
//     MARKET instead, and the market's trend component IS
//     RATE_NEUTRAL_CHANGE_PCT — so at defaults the two agree to the trend and
//     differ by the market's year. Subtracting both would net the trend out
//     twice.
//
//   THE MARKET — marketConditions.ts, in both limbs. The CHANGE benchmark is
//     derived from the components every carrier feels; the LEVEL is modelled
//     from a target loss ratio. A pool that raises its rate in a year the whole
//     market moved costs less satisfaction than one that raises it alone, and a
//     pool that sits permanently under a carrier's price is forgiven things a
//     dearer one would not be.
//
//   THEIR OWN LOSSES — RETIRED AS A DRIVER, and this was the third. See the
//     block below. The member's loss ratio is still built and still displayed on
//     the members table; it no longer touches satisfaction, because a member's
//     claims are not the pool's pricing.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE LOSS TERM IS RETIRED, AND IT WAS THE DESIGN'S CENTREPIECE FOR TWO
// COMMITS. RECORDED IN FULL, BECAUSE THE REASONING THAT BUILT IT WAS SOUND AND
// THE THING IT WAS BUILT FOR MOVED.
//
// It read
//
//     ownFault_i = clamp01( (c_i/M - 1) / (ceiling/M - 1) )
//
// — 0 at or below the book's mean experience, 1 at the worst the clamp permits,
// marketabilityOf's statistic run the other way — and it MODULATED the price
// reaction rather than adding a second penalty. The argument was that two
// independent penalties would make a member with a GOOD record facing a BIG
// increase only half-unhappy, when they are the member with the strongest
// grievance in the book.
//
// THAT ARGUMENT IS STILL RIGHT AND NO LONGER APPLIES. It was about an increase
// that CONTAINED the member's own modifier, so part of the increase really was
// theirs and the fault term said how much. The gap now contains only the pool's
// rate against the market — one decision, identical for every member of a
// line-year — and a member's claims record gives them no less standing to mind a
// pool-wide rate rise. Damping it would attribute part of the pool's decision to
// the member: the same conflation, moved one term to the right.
//
// ⚠ AND IT CARRIED A CROSS-LINE ARTEFACT NOBODY CHOSE. Property has no rated
// members, so every Property member sat at fault 0 and took the full reaction
// while WC and GL averaged 0.116 and 0.124 and were systematically damped.
// Three lines reacting differently to one pricing decision, because of a
// credibility measurement about something else.
//
// ⚠ PROPERTY'S OLD NOTE HERE — that its members "take the FULL grievance on
// every price move, which is right, not degenerate" — was true and is now true
// of every member on every line, which is the tell that the term had stopped
// describing anything.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ SATISFACTION IS PER MEMBER PER LINE, AND Member.satisfaction IS ONE FIELD.
//
// Each line carries its own LinePoolState.members array, and this writes a COPY
// rather than mutating in place, so a member on WC and GL ends up with two
// independent satisfactions — WC's on WC's array, GL's on GL's. That is
// correct: the drivers are a bill on one line.
//
// What it costs is the pool-level view. simulationEngine's roster fold dedupes
// `memberList` by id and keeps the FIRST line's copy, so the members table shows
// the first ACTIVE line's number, exactly as `status` is folded (see Member.status's
// own note on the same hazard). MembershipPage is already a WC view — its payroll,
// loss-ratio and mod columns are all WC — so the column is consistent with the
// page it is on, and the page says so.
//
// ⚠ DO NOT "FIX" THIS BY MUTATING THE MEMBER IN PLACE. The arrays can alias
// across lines, so an in-place write would make the last line processed
// overwrite the others and the field would silently become Property's opinion
// of everything.

/**
 * THE CONVEX SCALE — satisfaction points per SQUARED percentage point of
 * market-adjusted bill change.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ⚠ THE FORM IS SQUARED AND NOT A THRESHOLD, AND THE THRESHOLD IS THE ONE THAT
 * LOOKS BETTER ON THE FIRST MEASUREMENT.
 *
 * Both were considered. A threshold-and-slope, max(0, |x| - T), matches
 * behaviour better on its face — people genuinely ignore small increases — and
 * measured on the gap distribution it separates far harder: with T at the
 * median |gap| the ordinary year contributes EXACTLY zero and the decision year
 * keeps its whole excess, a ratio in the tens against squaring's four.
 *
 * It is not taken, for one reason. T would have to be pinned to the gap's own
 * dispersion at defaults, because that is the only statistic available — and
 * the gap's dispersion at defaults is the MARKET BENCHMARK'S NOISE plus the
 * pool's own rate noise, not a fact about how members feel. Fitting a
 * behavioural bend to a measurement-error statistic is calibrating the
 * mechanism to hide its own noise, and it would move every time the benchmark
 * gained a component. Squaring has no bend to place: one scale, and the shape
 * is fixed.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE THRESHOLD DOES NOT ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM IT LOOKS LIKE IT
 * SOLVES. It kills the MEDIAN ordinary year and leaves the tail: the gap's SD
 * is 5-7pp per line while one stop on the funding slider is worth about +4pp,
 * so a p90 ordinary year still outweighs the decision under either form. What
 * convexity buys is the decision's SHARE of the year it lands in, and that is
 * the honest claim — not that noise has been removed.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE COEFFICIENT, AND IT IS ANCHORED RATHER THAN CHOSEN.
 *
 * A convex form cannot be pinned by a separation ratio — the previous commit
 * measured that gap and noise both scale linearly in the weight, so any
 * signal-to-noise criterion is empty. What CAN be pinned is where the convex
 * reaction crosses the linear one it replaces:
 *
 *     K x g^2 = W_lin x g   at   g = W_lin / K
 *
 * Set the crossover at THE GAP A TYPICAL YEAR CARRYING ONE FUNDING STOP
 * PRODUCES, and the reaction at the decision is unchanged while everything
 * smaller goes quiet and everything larger bites. Measured on the charged-rate
 * basis, 8 games x 10 years:
 *
 *     pooled median |gap| at defaults                  3.93pp
 *     one stop (Expected -> the 0.65 stop), own effect  +3.96pp
 *     crossover = the two together                       7.89pp
 *
 *     K = W_lin / 7.89 = 0.015 / 7.89 = 0.0019
 *
 * so W_lin is inherited, the crossover is measured, and nothing is picked.
 * What it does, against the linear form at the same anchor:
 *
 *     gap      convex     linear     ratio
 *     1.5pp    0.0043     0.0225     0.19x     an ordinary year goes quiet
 *     3pp      0.0171     0.0450     0.38x
 *     5pp      0.0475     0.0750     0.63x
 *     7.89pp   0.1183     0.1183     1.00x     the crossover, by construction
 *     13pp     0.3211     0.1950     1.65x     a funding stop on a bad year bites
 *     20pp     0.7600     0.3000     2.53x
 *
 * ⚠ THE CLAIM THIS SUPPORTS IS ABOUT SHARES, NOT ABOUT NOISE REMOVAL. In a year
 * carrying both a typical gap and one funding stop, the decision's share of the
 * member's move goes from 53% under the linear form to 78% under this one —
 * (7.89^2 - 3.93^2)/7.89^2 against (7.89 - 3.93)/7.89. That ratio is a property
 * of the FORM and is the same at any K, which is why it is the number worth

// THE SCALE RULING — THE FOUR POINTS-SCALE WEIGHTS CARRY A 3x SCALE, AND THE
// RELATIVE WEIGHTS AMONG THEM ARE UNTOUCHED.
//
// priceWeight, levelWeight, lossLevelWeight and surplusWeight are the four
// constants denominated in SATISFACTION POINTS. Each was multiplied by 3
// together, so every ratio derived between them survives exactly — term 3's
// spread against one funding stop, the surplus limb's quarter of the footprint,

// lossSaturation, lossValueShare and lossAmplifierSlope are SHAPES,
// anchorCentre is a LOCATION, levelHalfLifeYears is a TIME, surplusComfortable
// is a boundary in ratio units, and floor/ceiling are BOUNDS. Scaling any of

// so the ruling's exclusion list does not cover it; it was simply missed. The
// crossover between the two forms is linearEquivalent / priceWeight and is a
// GAP IN pp — a property of the game, which must not move when satisfaction is
// merely denominated more loudly. Scaling four of five moved it 7.89pp ->
// 2.63pp and failed two of section 4's assertions. Scaling all five holds it at
// 7.89pp. THE RULE IS "EVERY CONSTANT IN POINTS", NOT "THE FOUR".
//
// ⚠ SCALE CHANGES LEGIBILITY AND CANNOT CHANGE DISCRIMINATION. The passive and

   * ownChangeExplained was a discount whose only defensible value was 1.0, which

   * exactly — so there is nothing left to weight.
   *
   * faultDiscount followed it, and this is the part worth arguing rather than
   * asserting. It damped a member's reaction by how much their own loss ratio
   * explained their increase. That was the right shape when the increase
   * CONTAINED their own modifier: a member whose bill rose because their claims
   * rose had themselves to answer to. It is the wrong shape now. What is left in
   * the gap is the POOL'S rate against the market — one decision, identical for
   * every member of a line-year — and a member's claims record gives them no
   * less standing to mind a pool-wide rate rise. Keeping the damping would have
   * attributed part of the pool's decision to the member, which is the same
   * conflation moved one term to the right.
   *
   * ⚠ AND IT HAD A CROSS-LINE ARTEFACT NOBODY CHOSE. Property carries no rated
   * members — CREDIBILITY_Z.Property is 0 — so every Property member sat at
   * fault 0 and took the full reaction, while WC and GL members averaged 0.116
   * and 0.124 and were systematically damped. Three lines reacting differently to
   * the same pricing decision, because of a credibility measurement about
   * something else.
   *
   * ⚠ WHAT IT COSTS IS ALL THE WITHIN-YEAR TEXTURE, AND THAT IS THE CORRECT
   * CONSEQUENCE RATHER THAN A REGRESSION. Every member of a line-year now takes
   * an identical delta and an identical anchor. Per-member spread survives only
   * through enrolment history — when they joined, what they opened at, which
   * lines they carry — so Member.satisfaction is closer to a per-LINE quantity

   * precisely what has been ruled out of it. Genuine per-member variation would
   * need a per-member thing the pool DOES that is not the modifier: how a claim
   * was handled, a dividend felt differently by size, a service a member used.
   * None of those exist in the model. Until one does, a flat line-year is the

   *
   * THE RULE WAS: one stop on the funding slider should be worth the SAME
   * through the level as through the change, over the six years the gate traces.
   * The change-limb input used was 0.037 points — the six-year footprint
   * measured BEFORE the anchor existed. In the shipped model the anchor PULLS
   * every year at 20.6% of the remaining distance, and that pull damps the
   * change limb's accumulated difference as well as carrying the level's. So
   * 0.037 is not the quantity the rule names.
   *
   * MEASURED IN THE SHIPPED MODEL, one stop over six years splits:
   *
   *   level limb   0.037 points   anchor difference x (1 - 0.5^(6/3))
   *   change limb  0.009 points   what survives the pull
   *   total        0.045 points   which is the footprint the gate measures
   *
   * — about FOUR TO ONE, not one to one. Satisfying the rule as written would
   * need levelWeight = 0.030 x (0.009 / 0.037) = 0.0073.
   *
   * ⚠ 0.0073 IS NOT TAKEN, AND THE REASON IS THE ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT RATHER
   * THAN CONVENIENCE. The whole point of a level limb is that a gap applying
   * EVERY YEAR should outweigh one applying ONCE; forcing them equal over six
   * years contradicts that, and it would leave the full slider worth 0.10 points
   * end to end — below where the enrolment draw sat two commits ago, and back to
   * a scoreboard nobody can read. Four to one over six years, growing with how
   * long the decision is held, is what "applies every year" should mean.
   *
   * SO THE HONEST STATUS IS: a continuity choice, not a derivation. 0.030 makes
   * a sustained one-stop decision's SETTLED effect 0.049 points, which is close
   * to what the change term alone was worth before the anchor existed, so the
   * mechanic kept its scale across the structural change. That is a reason, and
   * it is a weaker one than the rule it replaces.
   *
   * ⚠ AND THE SPLIT IS NOW ASSERTED RATHER THAN RECORDED. member-satisfaction-

   * Expected -> the 0.95 stop moves the cushion -8.66% -> +9.88% on WC, so L
   * goes -3.85 -> +9.88 and the anchor moves 0.41 points. On Property, whose

   * It read: one band step is worth one stop on the funding slider through the
   * market level, 0.116 points — the same rule lossLevelWeight uses. THAT RULE
   * CANNOT BE USED HERE. Funding is what BUILDS surplus: one stop up raises the
   * price, which costs satisfaction through the market level, and accumulates
   * surplus, which pays it back through this term. Calibrating this term against
   * the very decision that drives it guarantees the two cancel.
   *
   * MEASURED, AT 0.115: one stop moved the surplus band +0.50 steps, worth
   * +0.058 anchor points, against the market level's -0.102 — so 56% of the
   * funding decision was cancelled, the six-year footprint of one stop fell from
   * -0.045 to +0.006, and member-satisfaction-check's section 6 went red on the
   * ruling it has asserted since the level term shipped: a decision must
   * outweigh the enrolment draw. A scoreboard whose two channels cancel reports
   * nothing, and the gate caught it.
   *
   * THE RULE THAT REPLACES IT IS A BOUND RATHER THAN A MATCH: this term may not
   * cancel more than a QUARTER of the funding decision it responds to.
   *
   * ⚠ AND THE BOUND HAD TO BE SOLVED FROM THE MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN ESTIMATED,
   * WHICH IS THE SECOND TIME THIS CONSTANT WAS WRONG BY ARITHMETIC. The estimate
   * — one stop moves the band half a step, so 0.25 x 0.116 / 0.50 = 0.058 —
   * still left 67% cancelled, because surplus COMPOUNDS over the six years the
   * footprint is measured across while the estimate treated one stop as one
   * step. Measured on section 6's own arm, the six-year footprint runs
   *
   *     w = 0.115  ->  +0.006      w = 0.058  ->  -0.015
   *
   * so d(footprint)/dw = +0.368 and the un-cancelled footprint is -0.036. A
   * quarter of that is -0.027, which needs w = 0.024.
   *
   * WHAT THAT LEAVES: the ladder spans Deficient -2 steps to Strong +1, so end to
   * end it is worth 0.155 points against the funding slider's own 0.41. That is
   * 38% of the funding mechanic, and it is what the requirement permits: this

   * halves — the decision stays visible, and the cancellation stays inside the
   * quarter.
   *
   * ⚠ RE-SOLVED TWICE IN TWO COMMITS, AND THE BOUND DID NOT CHANGE EITHER TIME.
   * The ruling is still a quarter. Both re-solves were driven by the boundary
   * moving under it, which is trigger 1 below doing exactly what it says.
   *
   * FIRST, 0.024 -> 0.0469, when surplusComfortable was solved to the median of
   * default play and fell 1.15 -> 0.2399. A funding stop then crossed fewer band
   * steps for the same weight, so more weight fitted under the same quarter.
   *
   * SECOND, 0.0469 -> 0.0344, when WC took a supplied CLF curve and the boundary
   * fell again to 0.0258, against a limb-off footprint of -0.0594.
   *
   * THIRD, 0.0344 -> 0.0516, when WC's aggregate volatility was raised and the
   * boundary rose to 0.1385. Bisected over [0, 0.20] on the SOLVED boundary,
   * seven passes, 24 games:
   *
   *     w = 0.0500  ->  footprint -0.0573,  23.5% cancelled
   *     w = 0.0516  ->  footprint -0.0566,  24.4% cancelled   <- shipped
   *     w = 0.0531  ->  footprint -0.0561,  25.2% cancelled   <- breaches
   *
   * against a limb-off footprint of -0.0749. It is the largest value on that
   * grid inside the bound, so the headroom is 0.6pp BY CONSTRUCTION and section
   * 6 will assert at 24.4% against 25.0%. That is deliberate: both quantities
   * are seeded and deterministic, so the gate is stable at that margin, and any
   * change to the book that moves the footprint trips it immediately rather than
   * eroding the bound quietly. A tripwire that sits against its bound is doing

   * text said what to do: re-solve the weight, do not relax the bound.
   *

   * crosses and that depends on where the boundary sits. Solving the two
   * independently, or this one first, gives a weight calibrated against a ladder

   *
   * ⚠ WHAT TRIGGERS A RE-SOLVE, CHECKABLY, IN ORDER:

   *      no tolerance to quote.
   *   2. Section 6's CANCELLATION line leaving 20-25%. Below 20% the term has
   *      lost weight the bound would allow it; above 25% it breaches the ruling.
   *      Re-solve from the measurement. DO NOT RELAX THE BOUND — that has been
   *      the wrong answer twice, and the gate says so in its own failure text.
   *   3. The limb-off footprint (the same line's `surplusWeight at 0` figure)

   *                           -0.1895 -> +0.0870 and crossed zero.
   *   2. cancellation         24.1% -> 18.5%. FIRED — below the 20% floor. The
   *                           limb has lost weight the bound would allow it.
   *   3. limb-off footprint   -0.2243 -> -0.2127, a 5.2% move. NOT FIRED.
   *
   * WHY IT FIRED: the surplus limb cancels part of a funding decision by moving
   * DOWN the band ladder as the decision moves satisfaction up, and how much it
   * can cancel depends on how many band steps the line has left to fall. WC used
   * to open Deficient — the bottom step — on essentially every seed, so at
   * defaults it was already at the floor and the limb had its full range below
   * it. Re-centred, WC opens across all four bands (Deficient 55.3% -> 38.8%,
   * Strong 36.0% -> 46.9% of member-years), so a given funding decision now
   * crosses fewer steps and cancels less. The limb did not get weaker; the
   * ladder got more room above the floor.
   *
   * ⚠ AND TRIGGER 3'S REFERENCE IS STALE BY EXACTLY THE 3x SCALE CHANGE, WHICH
   * IS THE SAME DEFECT THIS BLOCK WARNS ABOUT FOUR PARAGRAPHS ABOVE. It names
   * -0.0749. The live limb-off figure is -0.2243, and 0.0749 x 3 = 0.2247. The
   * footprint did not move: the constants were re-denominated 3x (surplusWeight
   * 0.0516 -> 0.1548, see the scale block) and this trigger's denominator was not
   * carried with them. Read literally it says FIRED at a 199% move when nothing
   * has moved at all — precisely the "trigger that names the wrong denominator"
   * failure recorded above, committed a second time by a different change. The
   * figures on this line are therefore quoted against -0.2247, the rescaled
   * reference, and the 5.2% above is measured against that. WHOEVER RE-SOLVES
   * NEXT SHOULD FIX THE LITERAL IN TRIGGER 3 RATHER THAN RE-DERIVING IT.
   *
   * ⚠ WHY NO RE-SOLVE HERE, AND IT IS THIS BLOCK'S OWN PRECEDENT. Trigger 1 says
   * a new boundary makes surplusWeight stale BY CONSTRUCTION, and the order rule
   * says the weight is solved ON the boundary. surplusComfortable has NOT fired,
   * so the boundary stays at 0.1385 — and the SOLVE mode's 0.1984 was measured on
   * a 0.2288 boundary, so it is NOT the value to paste for an unchanged one. Only
   * trigger 2 has fired, and acting on it alone means re-weighting the limb on a
   * boundary that is itself 90% of the way to moving. That is a ruling about the
   * ladder, taken on the strength of a side effect of a capital change — which is
   * the thing the Adequate-band note below says it declined to do, in the same
   * words, for the same reason. Recorded so the next person sees it was noticed
   * rather than missed. The gate is GREEN at 18.5%: it asserts at most a quarter,
   * and 18.5% is inside that. It is the re-solve RULE that has fired, not the
   * gate.
   *
   * ⚠ ALL THREE OF THESE FIRED AT ONCE AT THE COMMIT AFTER THEY WERE WRITTEN,
   * WHICH IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THEY WORK. The CLF swap moved the boundary
   * 0.214 against trigger 1's 0.10, pushed the cancellation to 31.6% against
   * trigger 2's 20-25%, and moved the limb-off footprint -0.0805 -> -0.0594,
   * 26% against trigger 3's 20%. None of that touched this file. A trigger that
   * has never fired is an untested trigger; these are now tested.
   *
   * ⚠ THIS IS ONE OF THE TWO RECORDED EXCEPTIONS TO THE RELATIVE-TARGET RULE in
   * docs/WORKING_PRACTICES.md ("A constant pinned to a ratio re-derives itself.
   * One pinned to a number goes silently stale"). The rule says to pin a
   * calibrated constant to a ratio wherever the quantity has a natural
   * reference; this one has none, and the reason is below so nobody spends an
   * afternoon looking for one.
   *
   * ⚠ AND IT CANNOT BE EXPRESSED RELATIVELY EITHER, FOR A DIFFERENT REASON THAN
   * THE BOUNDARY'S. This weight multiplies a DISCRETE numerator — band steps
   * crossed — over a CONTINUOUS denominator, the footprint in satisfaction
   * points. No fixed ratio between them survives a book change, because the step
   * count changes in jumps while the footprint changes smoothly. What IS already
   * relative is the RULE: "a quarter of the footprint." That is why the bound
   * never went stale while the value solved against it did. Term 3's spread
   * could be stated relatively (see lossLevelWeight) precisely because its
   * target is a continuous quantity both sides share.

   *
   * Pooled over WC and GL, n 29980, median 0.1385.
   *
   * ⚠ THE POOLED MEDIAN IS A KNIFE-EDGE STATISTIC HERE AND THE NEXT RE-SOLVE
   * SHOULD KNOW IT. WC's distribution sits almost entirely below zero and GL's
   * almost entirely above, with near-equal n, so the pooled median lands in the
   * thin overlap between them and moves far for a small shift in either line.
   * Across the WC volatility change WC's own median moved only -0.2196 ->
   * -0.1895, 0.03, while the POOLED median moved 0.0258 -> 0.1385, 0.11 — nearly
   * four times as far, from a shift in one line and none in the other. WC's
   * sample also fell 16,020 -> 15,150 member-years, 5.4%, which is games ending
   * early: a more volatile WC insolves more often, and that reweights the pool
   * as well as moving it. The RULE is still the right one — the boundary belongs
   * where default play sits — but its estimator is fragile in a way a single
   * line's median would not be, and a future reader seeing a large move should
   * check whether either line moved at all before concluding the book did.
   *
   * ⚠ THE TRIGGER BELOW FIRED AT THE VERY NEXT COMMIT, AND THE PATH IS WORTH
   * KNOWING BECAUSE NOTHING ABOUT IT LOOKS LIKE SATISFACTION. This constant was
   * solved to 0.2399 on the measurement one commit earlier — WC then read median
   * 0.1831 — and the next commit installed a SUPPLIED CLF CURVE FOR WC. That
   * curve is heavier than the derived table it replaced, so WC's 90% stop went
   * 1.3120 -> 1.4730; reserveMarginCLF is staticClf(line, 0.90); and
   * reserveRiskMarginNeeded = expectedNetUnpaidLoss x (reserveMarginCLF - 1),
   * which rose about 52% on WC. That quantity is the DENOMINATOR of
   * excessCapitalRatio, so WC's median fell 0.1831 -> -0.2196 and the pooled
   * median 0.2399 -> 0.0258, a move of 0.214 against a 0.10 trigger. A pricing
   * table reached a satisfaction constant through the reserve margin, in one
   * commit, with no edit to this file. The trigger is what caught it.
   *
   * ⚠ AND THE VALUE THIS REPLACES WAS MEASURED ON A BOOK THAT NO LONGER EXISTS.
   * The superseded note recorded median 1.279 on WC and 0.969 on GL and set the
   * boundary at 1.15 on them. Those numbers were taken before the roster freeze,
   * before NO_NEW_BUSINESS became the default appetite, and before
   * STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM's fourth re-solve. The ratio's denominator is a
   * RESERVE risk margin: with the book frozen at enrolment and no new business,
   * reserves accumulate against a premium base that no longer grows, so the
   * excess collapses relative to them. 1.15 is now reached by 10.9% of WC
   * member-years and 24.9% of GL's — the band was saturating from the other
   * side, which is the failure section 8(c) exists to catch.
   *
   * ⚠ THE Adequate BAND IS STILL THIN AND IS NO LONGER COLLAPSED, AND THE LIMIT
   * IS IN THE RULE RATHER THAN IN THIS VALUE. Adequate spans
   * [0, surplusComfortable), so a boundary near zero leaves it a sliver. At the
   * previous 0.0258 it held 0.5% of WC member-years and 0.4% of GL's — a
   * four-step ladder behaving as three. At 0.1385 it holds 4.3% and 9.5%,
   * against Deficient 55.3% / 19.4% and Strong 36.0% / 64.0%. Recovered, not
   * fixed: the band is occupied again because the boundary happened to move
   * away from zero, not because anything decided it should be. The four-step ladder is behaving as a three-step one,
   * and the distinction the top boundary was supposed to draw — "at the
   * requirement" against "comfortably above it" — has stopped being a
   * distinction. section 8(c) still passes, because it asks whether the band
   * discriminates at all and it does; it does not ask whether every band is
   * occupied.
   *
   * ⚠ WHAT THAT MEANS IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN: the rule is "the median of default
   * play", and when default play's median sits AT the requirement the rule
   * necessarily puts the top boundary on top of the middle one. That is not
   * fixed by re-solving; it is fixed by deciding whether the ladder should have
   * a floor under the Adequate band, or whether three steps is the honest number
   * once a pool at defaults is running at its margin. NOT TAKEN HERE — this
   * commit's ruling is about a CLF curve, and changing the ladder's shape on the
   * strength of a side effect would be a second ruling taken quietly. It is
   * recorded so the next person sees it was noticed rather than missed.
   *
   * ⚠ WHAT TRIGGERS A RE-SOLVE, CHECKABLY: run the SOLVE mode above and compare
   * its pooled median against this value. It is stale once they differ by more
   * than 0.10 — which is not a round number but the WIDTH OF THE Thin BAND
   * (surplusBandOf's -0.10 edge), the one length scale this ladder already
   * contains. A drift smaller than the narrowest band cannot move a member
   * across a boundary; a drift larger than it can. Anything that changes surplus
   * accumulation relative to the reserve risk margin moves it: the starting
   * capital ratios, the default appetite, the roster freeze, the reserve margin
   * factors, the funding default. The 1.15 -> 0.2399 move was 0.91, nine times
   * that trigger, and nothing was watching for it.
   *
   * ⚠ THIS IS THE OTHER RECORDED EXCEPTION TO THE RELATIVE-TARGET RULE in
   * docs/WORKING_PRACTICES.md. The rule holds generally — term 3's spread and
   * the surplus cancellation bound, both relative, survived five structural
   * changes untouched while the two absolute-pinned quantities drifted 16-17%.
   * This constant is one of the two places it cannot be applied.
   *
   * ⚠ IT CANNOT BE EXPRESSED RELATIVELY, AND THAT IS WHY IT WENT STALE SILENTLY.
   * There is no runtime distribution to normalise against: surplusBandOf sees
   * ONE ratio, for one member-year, and a rolling quantile would both need new
   * stored state and make a member's band depend on other line-years. So the
   * RULE is relative and the VALUE is absolute, and only the rule survives a
   * book change. The trigger above is the substitute for the normalisation this
   * constant cannot have.
   *
   * ⚠ PROPERTY DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AND IS EXCLUDED FROM THE DERIVATION RATHER
   * THAN AVERAGED INTO IT. Its median ratio is 3.11 and 75% of its member-years
   * sit in the positive band at the old boundary. The reason is structural and
   * is a real limitation of reading this quantity: reserveRiskMarginNeeded is a
   * RESERVE risk margin, Property is short-tail so its reserves are small, and
   * its actual exposure is a $75M catastrophe that this denominator does not
   * measure at all. The term is therefore close to constant on Property, and
   * that is a property of the measure rather than of the pool. Pooling it in
   * would drag the boundary up by its own irrelevance.

   * TERM 5 — CASH MOVING BETWEEN THE POOL AND THE MEMBER, as a share of the
   * member's own bill. A dividend received is positive; an assessment paid is
   * negative. Per point of share, on the DELTA.
   *
   * ⚠ IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE MODEL HAD A DIVIDEND'S COST AND NOT ITS BENEFIT,
   * AND THE SIGN CAME OUT BACKWARDS. Measured before this limb, over 10 games x
   * 10 years: paying a 15% dividend every year left the stock 0.14 points LOWER
   * than baseline, and levying a 25% assessment left it 0.12 points HIGHER. The
   * mechanism was confirmed through the surplus band — Strong 79% at baseline,
   * 49% under dividends, 93% under assessments. That half is RIGHT: a member
   * does notice the pool is thinner, and term 4 is doing its job. What was
   * missing is that the money went to them. Nothing in four limbs recorded a
   * member receiving a cheque or being billed one, so the only trace a
   * distribution left was the hole it made in the surplus.
   *
   * ⚠ A LIMB, NOT A REWEIGHT, AND THAT WAS THE RULING. Rebalancing surplus
   * against price would have bought the sign back by breaking two terms that
   * were each measured and each correct. The defect is an ABSENCE, and an
   * absence is fixed by adding the thing.
   *
   * ⚠ ON THE DELTA RATHER THAN THE ANCHOR, because a dividend is an EVENT and
   * not a standing condition. It lands in the year it is paid and then decays
   * toward the anchor like a price shock, which is the opposite call from a
   * programme's service limb — a programme is a standing condition and belongs
   * on the anchor. Same reasoning, opposite answer, for the same reason.
   *
   * ⚠ ASYMMETRIC THROUGH gratitudeLambda RATHER THAN A NEW CONSTANT. A bill is
   * felt more than a refund, which is exactly what that constant already says
   * about a rate rise against a rate cut, and reusing it keeps this from
   * becoming a fourth unexamined number in a family the header above already
   * warns is "all the same number's cousins". An assessment reacts at full
   * strength; a dividend at 1/2.25 of it.
   *
   * ⚠ LINEAR, NOT CONVEX, for the LEVEL term's reason rather than the change
   * term's: there is no noise to suppress. A dividend is a decision a player
   * made, not a noisy year, so there is nothing for convexity to separate it
   * from.
   *
   * ⚠ THE FIRST SATISFACTION CONSTANT WITH A CALIBRATION TARGET RATHER THAN A
   * JUDGEMENT, AND THE TARGET IS THE THING TO KEEP. The coarse scalar's own
   * cash terms (dividend x 10, assessment x 8) are unsourced and were not
   * copied. THE TARGET: the limb must be large enough to FLIP THE SIGN — a 15%
   * dividend every year must leave the stock ABOVE baseline and a 25%
   * assessment BELOW it — while leaving the levers that already worked where
   * they were. Solved against that target rather than chosen; see
   * member-satisfaction-check, which asserts the sign rather than the number,
   * so re-solving it is free and the target is what must not move.
   *
   * ⚠ SOLVED AGAINST THAT TARGET. Swept over 14 games x 10 years, three lines,
   * paired on seeds, reading the pool's mean stock in the final year:

   *     cashWeight    15% dividend    25% assessment
   *        0.00         -0.149           +0.060        <- the defect
   *        1.00         +0.041           -0.807        <- flips, no margin
   *        1.20         +0.091           -0.982
   *        1.40         +0.129           -1.155
   *        1.60         +0.169           -1.328        <- ADOPTED
   *        1.80         +0.207           -1.502
   *
   * 1.60 is the lowest round value at which the dividend's effect is at least
   * as large as the defect it corrects — +0.169 against -0.149 — so a pool that
   * pays one is now as clearly better off as it was wrongly worse off. 1.00
   * flips the sign but only to +0.041, which is a sign change nobody could see.
   *
   * ⚠ THE ASSESSMENT MOVES ~8x FURTHER THAN THE DIVIDEND AND THAT IS THE POINT,
   * not a miscalibration. Three things compound: gratitudeLambda discounts the
   * refund (2.25x), the assessment slider's range is wider (0.25 against 0.15,
   * 1.67x), and term 4 now pushes the SAME WAY as term 5 on an assessment
   * (surplus rises, Strong 93%) while pushing AGAINST it on a dividend (surplus
   * drains, Deficient 39%). A pool that bills its members is docked by both
   * limbs; a pool that pays them is credited by one and docked by the other,
   * which is what a member actually experiences.

// ⚠ NOT CONVEX, AND THE REASON IS NOT SYMMETRY WITH THE CHANGE TERM. Three
// arguments, none of which is "the other one is squared":
//
//   1. THERE IS NO NOISE TO SUPPRESS. Convexity's job in the change term is
//      separating a decision from a noisy year: the change gap's SD at defaults
//      is 4.3-5.1pp per line. The LEVEL gap's own year-to-year SD is the pool's
//      load moving, measured at 0.012-0.030 of load — about 1-2pp of cushion.
//      A curve that exists to push noise below the signal has nothing to push.
//
//   2. A LEVEL APPLIES EVERY YEAR AND CONVEXITY WOULD COMPOUND IT. A standing
//      gap held for a decade under a squared reaction is a standing squared
//      pull, which would dominate the change term within two years — the exact
//      failure the weighting question was asked about, arriving through the
//      form instead of the weight.
//
//   3. THE JUDGEMENT IN A LEVEL IS A THRESHOLD, NOT A CURVATURE. "A 2pp increase
//      is invisible and a 15pp one is a board conversation" is a statement about
//      curvature. The level's equivalent statement is "being dearer than the
//      alternative is different in kind from being cheaper", which is a KINK —
//      and it sits at zero, where MARKET_TARGET_LOSS_RATIO puts it.
//
// ⚠ THE KINK IS WHERE THE UNMEASURED JUDGEMENT EARNS ITS KEEP. The target loss
// ratio does not set how hard satisfaction reacts — that scale is absorbed by
// levelWeight, so 60% and 70% give the same behaviour at a different weight.
// What it sets is WHERE THE CUSHION CROSSES ZERO, and because the reaction is
// kinked there, crossing it more than doubles the marginal reaction. A pool
// funding past that point stops being the cheaper option and starts being the
// dearer one, which is a different conversation with a member.

// TERM 4 — SURPLUS ADEQUACY. A LEVEL, BANDED, AND IT READS WHAT ALREADY SHIPS.
//
// ⚠ NOTHING IS DERIVED HERE THAT THE ENGINE HAD NOT ALREADY COMPUTED. The brief
// asked whether capitalFundingGap and reserveRiskMarginNeeded answer this before
// deriving anything. THEY DO, and better than that: processLineYear already
// normalises them into excessCapitalRatio = (availableSurplus -
// reserveRiskMarginNeeded) / reserveRiskMarginNeeded, and already BANDS it into
// capitalAdequacyStatus at 0.25 / 0 / -0.10. So the quantity and the ladder both
// existed; this reads them.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS NOT REUSED IS THE TOP BOUNDARY. surplusComfortable replaces only
// that edge, at the median of default play; the two boundaries that carry an
// absolute meaning — at the requirement, and below it — are the shipped ones
// untouched, because 0 needs no derivation.
//
// ⚠ THE REASON RECORDED HERE FOR NOT REUSING 0.25 WAS MEASURED, WAS TRUE, AND IS
// NO LONGER TRUE. It read: the shipped 0.25 was drawn for a solvency LABEL, and
// as a satisfaction band it is saturated — 24 games x 10 years at defaults put
// 89.6% of WC line-years, 75.8% of GL's and 96.7% of Property's in "Strong",
// and a band holding nine line-years in ten reports nothing about the player.
// On the CURRENT book that is false. The same measurement now puts the pooled
// median of default play at 0.2399, within 0.01 of the shipped 0.25, so the
// ladder's own boundary would today be very nearly the derived one. The cause is
// the one that moved surplusComfortable: the roster freeze and NO_NEW_BUSINESS
// collapsed the excess relative to a reserve risk margin that keeps
// accumulating.
//
// ⚠ AND THE CONSTANT STAYS SEPARATE ANYWAY, BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT IS A
// COINCIDENCE AND NOT A DERIVATION. capitalAdequacyStatus's 0.25 is a solvency
// threshold: it does not move when default play moves, and it was not chosen to
// sit at a median. Aliasing this boundary to it would read as a shared rule and
// is not one — the two would part company again at the next book change, and
// this one would go stale with nothing pointing at it. Two constants that
// happen to agree are cheaper to maintain than one constant asked to mean two
// things.
//
// ⚠ THE RATIO IS LAST YEAR'S, NOT THIS YEAR'S, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE TWICE
// OVER. The satisfaction pass runs several hundred lines before the capital
// block, so this year's ratio does not exist yet — and it should not be used
// even if it did: the balance sheet a member can see when their bill arrives is
// the one that closed last year.
//
// ⚠ THIS LIMB IS A DRIFT SOURCE BY CONSTRUCTION, IT IS THE LARGEST ONE AT
// DEFAULTS, AND RE-SOLVING IT MADE THE DRIFT BIGGER RATHER THAN SMALLER. A LEVEL
// term reading a TRENDING quantity produces a trend in the anchor, and
// excessCapitalRatio trends upward through a game: the book is frozen at
// enrolment, so surplus accumulates against a premium base that does not grow.
// Measured over 24 games x 10 years at all-default decisions, the mean band step
// and what it adds to the anchor per game year:
//
//     line       band step/yr   anchor pts/yr at 1.15/0.024   at 0.2399/0.0469
//     WC            +0.0530            +0.00068                   +0.00248
//     GL            +0.1134            +0.00252                   +0.00532
//     Property      -0.0538            -0.00122                   -0.00252
//
// The stock closes 20.6% of its distance to the anchor per year, so it tracks a
// standing anchor trend at a lag. On WC and GL the observed drift comes in at
// about 0.6x the anchor trend — +0.0004 -> +0.0014 and +0.0044 -> +0.0062 across
// the re-solve, against predictions of +0.00248 and +0.00532 — so this limb
// accounts for essentially all of the drift on both lines, before and after.
// GL's +0.0062 is 31% of member-satisfaction-check's 0.020 bound.
//
// ⚠ AND THE BOUNDARY WAS NEVER THE CAUSE, WHICH IS WORTH SAYING BECAUSE IT LOOKS
// LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. Moving the boundary to the median does not remove
// the trend; it moves more member-years onto the rising side of it, and doubling
// the weight doubles what the trend is worth. Removing this drift would mean
// reading a DETRENDED ratio — a quantity relative to its own history rather than
// to a fixed boundary — which is the rolling-quantile plumbing surplusComfortable
// is recorded as not having. The drift is a known, bounded, measured cost of
// reading an absolute boundary, not a calibration error.
//
// ⚠ PROPERTY'S DRIFT IS NOT THIS LIMB, AND THE SIGN PROVES IT. The limb's own
// contribution there became MORE negative across the re-solve (-0.00122 ->
// -0.00252) while the observed drift became LESS negative (-0.0035 -> -0.0028).
// Whatever drives Property's drift is elsewhere and this term partly offsets it.
// Note also that Property's mean band step FALLS while its median ratio RISES
// (+0.2571/yr): catastrophe years drop a few member-years to Deficient at -2,
// and a widening left tail drags the mean down under a rising middle. On
// Property the mean and the median of this band point in opposite directions
// over a game, which is another face of the same measure problem below.
//
// ⚠ FLICKER IS REAL AND THE ANCHOR IS WHAT ABSORBS IT. Measured band-change
// rates per consecutive year pair at defaults: 13.0% WC, 18.5% GL, 6.9%
// Property at a 0.50 boundary, and 17.1 / 21.8 / 13.0 at 1.00. A three-year
// trailing mean of the ratio would cut those to 11.6 / 15.7 / 3.7 and is NOT
// taken, because it needs three prior results plumbed through and the anchor
// already damps what is left: a band flip that reverses next year moves the
// stock by one year of pull, 20.6% of the step, and then pulls back. A banded
// level feeding an ANCHOR is inherently flicker-tolerant in a way that the same
// band feeding a FLOW would not be.
