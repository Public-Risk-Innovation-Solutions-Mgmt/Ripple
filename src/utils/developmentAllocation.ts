// CLAIM-LEVEL DEVELOPMENT ALLOCATION — which claims a reserve movement lands on.
//
// Reserve development used to move a net reserve BALANCE, so a pool that had
// bought per-occurrence cover was not protected against it. Development lands on
// CLAIMS now, and the tower sees it.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ ALLOCATION IS SYMMETRIC. BOTH DIRECTIONS GO TO THE SAME OCCURRENCES,
// SIZE-WEIGHTED, AND THE SYMMETRY IS LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN TIDY.
//
// (It said "THE SAME TEN" until closure arrived. Ten is a FLOOR now, not a
// count — the set is drawn until it holds the movement it may have to absorb,
// and it is every open claim when that is fewer than ten. See THE SIZE OF THE
// SET, further down.)
//
// ⚠ THE ARGUMENT THAT STOOD HERE WAS "DETERIORATION IS CONCENTRATED, REDUNDANCY
// IS DIFFUSE", and it sent adverse movements to the largest 3 while favourable
// ones spread across the whole register. It is recorded rather than deleted,
// because it is the reason the asymmetry existed and it is weaker than it looked:
//
//   A LARGE CASE RESERVE TAKEN DOWN IS CONCENTRATED FAVOURABLE DEVELOPMENT. That
//   is one of the most ordinary events in a claims department — the reserve on a
//   serious injury is set high, the case settles for a fraction of it, and one
//   claim releases millions. "Redundancy is diffuse" describes attritional
//   redundancy and quietly asserts that the concentrated kind does not happen.
//
// ⚠ AND THE MISMATCH, NOT THE CONCENTRATION, WAS THE DEFECT. Cession is a convex
// function of occurrence size and is SIGN-BLIND: on identical state, +X and -X
// cede at the same rate to within 1.02x. Composing that with an asymmetric
// ROUTING is what manufactured recovery. Adverse dollars were steered onto the
// largest claims — the ones deepest inside placed layers, marginal cession 83.8%
// on WC — while favourable dollars spread across a register that is 56% below the
// attachment and cedes nothing there, marginal give-back 36.7%. Forty-seven
// points of free recovery per dollar of wobble, on a walk with no drift.
//
// Measured at defaults over 450 line-years before this commit: WC's register
// moved $17.7M FAVOURABLE and the reinsurer paid $48.2M.
//
// ⚠ THE GRID SAYS IT IS THE MISMATCH AND NOT THE RULE. Every adverse rule lands
// at 1.04-1.11x once favourable routes the same way, and NO cell reaches 1.00
// with the two sides differing (scripts/diagnostics/allocation-grid.ts):
//
//   adverse        favourable          ratio     WC     recovery at defaults
//   largest-1      proportional        2.15x   2.49x    $115.16M
//   largest-3      proportional        1.85x   2.13x     $87.32M   <- retired here
//   sizeWtd-3      proportional        1.63x   1.79x     $58.59M
//   sizeWtd-10     proportional        1.50x   1.67x     $38.29M
//   largest-3      same-as-adverse     1.06x   1.07x    -$28.26M
//   sizeWtd-10     same-as-adverse     1.04x   1.05x    -$28.16M   <- THIS RULE
//   proportional   proportional        1.01x   1.01x    -$28.95M
//
// Widening the adverse rule alone gets to 1.50x and stops: 3 -> 10 developing claims buys
// only 0.13x, because its limit is proportional adverse, which is the bottom row.
//
// ⚠ WHY TEN AND NOT THREE — a question about the FLOOR, since closure made ten
// a floor rather than a count. Ten answers the old objection at the point where
// it is actually true. "A single claim collapsing to nothing" is a real worry for
// one claim and much less of one for ten, and the symmetric rule at ten developing claims
// truncated a give-back 9 times against largest-1's 51 — the fewest in the
// family. Three would have been 17.
//
// ⚠ WHY SIZE-WEIGHTED AND NOT LARGEST. `largest` is deterministic, so which
// claims develop is in principle learnable from the register. It also selects
// claims FOR THE PROPERTY THAT MAKES THEM CEDE — always picking occurrences
// already over the retention is why the old rule cedes 83.6% on WC. A
// size-weighted draw keeps deterioration landing on big claims without making it
// a certainty that it lands on the ones the treaty covers.
//
// ⚠ THE ZERO-SUBSET PROBLEM THE ASYMMETRY WAS ALSO GUARDING AGAINST. A symmetric
// rule drove the subset to exactly zero 15 times in 4,320 line-years, and a claim
// at zero permanently loses its position above the retention. That guard is now
// structural rather than incidental: allocateDevelopment bounds a favourable
// movement by the total of the occurrences it will actually land on, and
// size-weights it within them, so no occurrence can be taken below zero at all.
// See THE POOL IS THE OCCURRENCES THAT RECEIVE THE DOLLARS, below.
//
// ⚠ THE TIME MISMATCH IS STILL A MECHANISM AND IS NO LONGER A MEASURABLE ONE.
// The markdown and the unwind are both proportional but applied at DIFFERENT
// TIMES — the markdown once at inception, the unwind spread over the horizon and
// interleaved with stochastic steps — so the shares the unwind restores are not
// the shares the markdown took, and the tower is convex. Recorded here because
// it is the same shape as the direction mismatch one order down and should not
// be rediscovered as new.
//
// This commit was expected to leave it standing and did not. Measured as the
// squeezed-minus-default difference in lifetime development cession, paired on
// (game, line) over 50 games x 20 years (cession-uplift-basis.ts):
//
//   WC   before  +2.4%  95% CI [ 0.6%,  4.1%]   EXCLUDES ZERO
//   WC   after   -0.6%  95% CI [-2.2%,  1.0%]   contains zero
//
// with GL and Property containing zero in both. Symmetric routing shrank it
// below what 50 games can resolve, because the developing set's cession stopped being
// sensitive to WHICH shares moved once both directions move the same ten.
// The mechanism remains; its magnitude does not. Do not chase it without
// re-measuring first.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS LEFT IS CONVEXITY, AND IT IS NOT A DEFECT. Cession is a convex
// function of occurrence size, so a driftless walk through it has positive
// expected cession by Jensen. That is what an excess-of-loss treaty on a claim
// that is still moving is worth. At defaults, over complete cohort lives:
// WC +4.1%, GL -0.5%, Property -0.1%, pool +0.3% of inception cession — against
// WC +9.9% and pool +2.8% under the retired asymmetric routing. Gated, with the
// limits set above the option value and below the asymmetry.
// ============================================================================
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE ALLOCATION RULE IS INVENTED AND IT IS THE CALIBRATION, for the ADVERSE
// side. There is no data behind "how many claims take the deterioration". The
// dollar-weighted share of adverse development that CEDES, measured over 60
// games x 10 years x 3 lines (scripts/diagnostics/development-cession-size.ts):
//
//   rule                  WC      GL   Property
//   largest-1          86.3%   72.6%     70.1%
//   largest-3 sized    83.6%   74.5%     52.2%     <- the default
//   largest-3 flat     86.3%   85.2%     38.4%
//   largest-10 sized   67.0%   62.1%     39.1%
//   largest-10 flat    46.7%   52.3%      8.6%
//   all sized          44.8%   47.5%     35.2%
//   all flat            0.5%    1.3%      1.8%
//
// FROM 0.5% TO 86% ON THE SAME EVENTS. That spread is why this is a named
// constant. Nothing in the model anchors it.
//
// ⚠ SIZE-WEIGHTED IS NOW THE DEFAULT, AND ITS DEFERRED COST WAS PAID HERE. It
// CONSUMES RNG DRAWS — one per developing claim picked, before this year's horizon and
// stepMultiplier draws — so every downstream draw in the `ibner` stream reseeds
// and a line-by-line null test against the parent baseline is unreadable. The
// stream is derived fresh per (seed, year, line), so the shift cannot accumulate
// across years; it re-aligns every January. How this commit was verified without
// that test is recorded in the commit message and in the mechanism switch below.
// ============================================================================
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ ONLY OCCURRENCES THAT CAN EVER AFFECT CESSION ARE TRACKED, AND THAT IS WHAT
// KEEPS PROPORTIONAL ALLOCATION INSIDE RULING 8's STORAGE BUDGET.
//
// Spreading favourable development across the whole register sounds like it
// needs the whole register — ~500 occurrences per WC accident year. It does not.
// An occurrence BELOW the retention cedes nothing, and a favourable movement
// only shrinks it, so it can never begin to cede. Its value is therefore
// irrelevant to every cession this cohort will ever make; only its SHARE of the
// register matters, and one scalar carries that.
//
// So the cohort stores the occurrences at or above the retention, plus the
// developing claims, plus `untrackedTotal`. Measured: 2.6 occurrences per WC accident
// year reach the $1M retention, 4.8 on GL, 0.4 on Property, worst case 13.
// A handful of records, and the cession arithmetic is EXACT rather than
// approximated.

// ⚠ RESELECTION — THE DEVELOPING SUBSET FOLLOWS CLOSURE, AND THE BENCH IS WHAT
// MAKES A SIZE-WEIGHTED REPLACEMENT POSSIBLE AT ALL.
//
// Claims close now (claimClosure.ts). A closed claim has paid everything it
// will ever pay, so it cannot be the one an accident year's deterioration lands
// on, and a subset frozen at inception ends its life pointing entirely at
// settled files. The alternative to replacing them — letting the set SHRINK —
// leaves a cohort with no open developing claims retaining its development ENTIRE, like
// a seed cohort with no register: no cession at all on a cohort that still
// carries an unpaid balance and still develops. Measured before this commit at
// 0.59% of GL cohort-valuations and 0.61% of Property's. That is wrong at any
// rate, so the set is replenished.
//
// ⚠ THE REPLACEMENT IS DRAWN SIZE-WEIGHTED FROM THE OPEN POOL — THE SAME RULE
// AS INCEPTION — AND NOT "THE LARGEST OPEN CLAIM". Two reasons, and the second
// is the one that would have cost money:
//
//   A DIFFERENT REPLACEMENT RULE MAKES THE SET'S COMPOSITION DEPEND ON HOW MANY
//   CLAIMS HAVE CLOSED. Draw one way at inception and another at replacement
//   and the subset drifts toward the replacement rule's preference as the
//   cohort ages — a second-order asymmetry of exactly the kind the free-lunch
//   work removed, arriving through the passage of time instead of through the
//   sign of a movement.
//
//   AND `largest-open` PULLS THE SET TOWARD THE TOP OF THE REMAINING
//   DISTRIBUTION, which is the concentration that raises clamping and spill.
//   The header above already records what always picking the claims the treaty
//   covers does to the cession rate: 83.6% on WC under `largest`.
//
// ⚠ WHY A BENCH RATHER THAN A RULE OVER THE TRACKED SET. "Draw size-weighted
// from the open pool" needs the pool, and by valuation time there isn't one:
// everything not tracked has collapsed into `untrackedTotal`, a single scalar,
// which is precisely what keeps this mechanism inside Ruling 8's storage
// budget. Promoting from the tracked occurrences outside the set is not an option
// either — tracked is the developing set plus the occurrences at or above the
// retention, of which there are 2.6 per WC accident year, 4.8 on GL and 0.4 on
// Property, and almost all of those are developing already. Nothing to promote.
//
// So the draw happens at INCEPTION, while the register still exists, and the
// result waits on the cohort. The bench is drawn size-weighted WITHOUT
// REPLACEMENT from the register with the developing set and the tracked occurrences
// already removed, i.e. it is the continuation of the same successive-sampling
// sequence that chose the developing set. Drawing size-weighted from the bench at
// valuation time is therefore a draw from a size-weighted sample of the
// register rather than from the register itself — the honest statement of what
// this buys and what it does not.
//
// ⚠ AND THE BENCH DRAW TAKES ITS OWN STREAM, WHICH IS WHAT KEEPS THE CHANGE
// MEASURABLE. sizeWeighted consumes one draw per pick. Taking the bench's picks
// from `ibner` would move every downstream draw in that stream and re-roll
// every game, so the whole commit would arrive as an indistinguishable mixture
// of mechanism and reseed. The set still takes its ten picks from `ibner`
// in the same order and the same place, bit for bit; the bench and every
// reselection draw come from streams derived per (seed, accident year,
// valuation year, purpose). The `ibner` stream is untouched by this commit.
//
// ⚠ THE BENCH CAN RUN OUT, AND WHEN IT DOES THE SET SHRINKS. It is a fixed
// depth, so a cohort that closes more developing claims than the bench can replace ends
// up short — the shrink case, arriving late instead of immediately. That is a
// bounded, measured cost rather than an argument against the bench:
// development-cession-check counts it.
//
// ⚠ THE DEPTH IS 40 BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE PROPERTY STOPS IMPROVING, and that
// is a fact about the registers rather than a taste. Occurrences per accident
// year, and how many of them are still open at curve age t:
//
//   line        occ/AY   open t2   t3     t4     t6     t8
//   WC           474.7     168.7  118.6   89.0   52.9   34.7
//   GL           315.8     135.7   70.5   34.5    8.3    1.3
//   Property      39.0      10.1    5.2    2.7    0.8    0.1
//
// Property's whole register is 39 occurrences, so a bench of 40 IS the register
// and no deeper bench can help it. Measured over 12 games x 20 years, the share
// of developing cohort-valuations with NO open developing claim at all — the shrink
// pathology, where a cohort that still carries an unpaid balance and still
// develops retains its development entire and cedes nothing:
//
//   bench depth        WC       GL   Property    poolState at yr 20

// Property is FLAT from 40 to 80 because the register is exhausted, not the
// bench: its residual 5.21% is accident years with genuinely nothing open left.
// GL buys 0.47 points for another 31 KB and WC buys nothing. 40 is where the
// curve turns.
//
// ⚠ AND FOR PROPERTY THAT MEANS STORING THE WHOLE REGISTER, which is worth
// saying plainly because it weakens the argument at the top of this file for
// exactly one line. `untrackedTotal` exists so a cohort does not carry ~500
// occurrences; that argument is about WC (475/yr) and GL (316/yr). Property
// writes 39 occurrences a year and was never the case the scalar was protecting
// against.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ RECORDED, NOT FIXED: THE FULLY-CLOSED REGISTER THAT IS STILL UNPAID.
//
// The residual above — accident years with nothing open left to promote — is
// where the next reader meets a state this model does not currently explain,
// so it is written down here rather than left to be rediscovered.
//
// A cohort can reach a valuation with EVERY claim in its register closed while
// the cohort still carries an unpaid balance and still develops. Measured
// before this commit at 0.59% of GL cohort-valuations and 0.61% of Property's,
// with the worst case carrying 19.2% of its ultimate still unpaid on a
// register where every file is settled.
//
// ⚠ IT IS NEITHER REOPENING NOR LATE EMERGENCE. Closure here is monotone by
// construction — a claim closed at one valuation is closed at every later one,
// which is the property claimClosure.ts's fixed per-claim uniform exists to
// guarantee — and there is no late reporting anywhere in the model: the report
// lag went with WC's IBNR and the closure curves were refitted onto a
// no-late-reporting basis precisely so that nothing arrives after inception.
// So neither of the two mechanisms that would explain a settled register still
// owing money is present.
//
// ⚠ IT IS TWO CLOCKS THAT NEVER TALK, and that is by design one level down.
// Payment runs on the payout pattern, in DOLLARS, per cohort. Closure runs on
// the closure curve, in COUNTS, per claim. claimClosure.ts's header sets out
// why they must not be derived from each other — a closed claim has paid
// everything it will pay, an open one has not, and the share of a cohort's
// dollars that has left is not the share of its files that are finished. What
// nothing enforces is the other direction: that the count clock cannot reach
// 100% while the dollar clock is short. Closure by count runs ahead of payment
// by dollars everywhere (GL at age 2: 56.7% of files closed against 31.0% of
// dollars paid), and at the tail that lead occasionally laps it.
//
// NOT FIXED HERE because the fix is a change to one of the two clocks — either
// the closure curve is conditioned on the cohort's paid position, or the payout
// pattern is conditioned on the closed count — and both re-fit calibrated
// parameters that this commit is not touching. Reselection makes the state
// VISIBLE (a set with no open member to promote) where it was previously
// invisible; it does not create it and does not cure it.

// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE SIZE OF THE SET: ENOUGH CLAIMS TO HOLD THE MOVEMENT, NOT TEN CLAIMS.
//
// THE RULE WAS NEVER "TEN". Ten was a proxy for "enough to absorb the step",
// and it held for as long as cohorts had hundreds of claims open. Closure ended
// that. The development step is a percentage of the COHORT's outstanding and it
// is placed on a SUBSET holding part of the register; once the subset's share
// falls below the size of the movement, the movement cannot fit, the subset
// zeroes, and the remainder spills. Necessarily — it is arithmetic, not a bug
// in the allocator.
//
// So the set is drawn until it HOLDS ENOUGH, with `claimCount` as a FLOOR
// rather than a cap:
//
//   keep drawing while  (fewer than `floor` developing)  OR  (held < minHold)
//   stop when either is satisfied and the other cannot be, i.e. when nothing
//   open remains to add
//
// ⚠ `minHold` IS A ONE-SIGMA FAVOURABLE STEP ON THIS COHORT'S OWN OUTSTANDING,
// AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A PERCENTILE. A percentile needs a percentile
// chosen, and nothing anchors that choice — it would be a second invented
// constant sitting next to `claimCount`, which this file's header already calls
// the calibration. One sigma is the scale the step distribution states about
// itself: it is where the diagnosis was made ("its eventful step is sigma
// 1.543, so a one-sigma favourable move is a 79% takedown") and it needs no
// tuning. See ibnerOneSigmaTakedown in simulationEngine, which is where the
// cohort's sigma lives.
//
// ⚠ THE FLOOR IS NOT LIFTED WHEN THE SET ALREADY HOLDS ENOUGH, and that is what
// keeps this from being a recalibration in disguise. Removing the cap entirely
// — every open claim always develops — was measured and rejected: the ratios do
// not move (WC 1.06x, GL 1.04x, Property 1.07x, identical) but the CESSION
// RATES do, WC's adverse falling 51.0% -> 43.5% and GL's 60.2% -> 55.1%,
// because spreading a movement over twice as many claims puts less of it above
// the retention. That is the `all sized` row of the header's grid, and moving
// onto it is a calibration decision this rule has no business making.
//
// ⚠ THE LIFT ENGAGES ON 1.06% OF DEVELOPING COHORT-VALUATIONS, ALMOST ALL OF
// THEM PROPERTY, and the sets it produces run to 11-16 occurrences against the
// floor of 10. It is a live mechanism, not a bound waiting for a future that
// never comes.
//
// ⚠ AND IT ENGAGES FAR MORE OFTEN THAN THE REALISED MOVEMENT OVERFLOWS, which
// is the point of sizing on the DISTRIBUTION rather than on the draw. Measured
// against realised movements over 4,291 developing-mode allocations (15 games x
// 10 years x 2 arms), before this rule existed:
//
//   line       favourable   |mov| > set   open claims outside the set   open bench
//   WC              1,001          0.0%                            n/a          n/a
//   GL                740          3.5%                           0.0%        empty
//   Property          458         20.5%                           0.0%        empty
//
// Read only those columns and the conclusion is that nothing can be done: the
// set already contained every open claim the cohort could reach — median
// set/open of 1.00 on all three lines — and the bench was empty every time.
// That is true AT THE MOMENT OF OVERFLOW and it is not the whole picture,
// because by then the year's draw has happened. Sizing against a one-sigma step
// asks the question a valuation earlier, while open occurrences are still on the
// bench to be promoted, and that is where the 1.06% comes from.
//
// ⚠ WHAT SURVIVES THE LIFT IS THE BIGGER FINDING. `underheld` counts it: 3.41%
// of developing cohort-valuations hold less than a one-sigma step WITH NOTHING
// OPEN LEFT TO ADD, worst case holding nothing at all against a step it must
// absorb.
// A reserve developing beyond what its open claims are worth is the two-clock
// problem recorded below, arriving through the front door:
// payment runs on the payout pattern in dollars per cohort, closure runs on the
// closure curve in counts per claim, and nothing stops the count clock reaching
// 100% while the dollar clock is short. At that point no allocation rule can
// place the movement on open claims, because there are none left worth enough.
// The rule here is the part that CAN be fixed by allocation; the residual is
// not, and it is reported rather than absorbed.

// ⚠ THIS IS WHAT STOPS UNDERFUNDING FROM BUYING REINSURANCE. Before it, the
// claims were seeded at their FULL DRAWN values while the reserve was booked at
// (1 - bias) of them, so the unwind pushed claims PAST their drawn value instead
// of restoring them TO it, and the extra height cedes. Measured: squeezed
// funding recovered $27.47M more on WC than defaults on the same seeds, 95% CI
// [$21.20M, $33.74M], with every line diverging the same way.
//
// ⚠ AND THE MARKDOWN ALONE DOES NOT FIX IT — the GIVE-BACK is required, and this
// is the part that is easy to miss. Writing the telescoping out:
//
//     total = cede(drawn) + [cede(final) - cede(marked)]
//           = cede(drawn) + cede(drawn) - cede(marked) + lognormal
//
// so squeezed would still exceed defaults by cede(drawn) - cede(marked) — about
// $30M on WC, the same order and the same sign as the divergence being fixed.
// The claims would end in the right place and the cession still would not.
//
// The reason is that inception cession is taken on the DRAWN register while the
// development ledger starts from the MARKED one, so a band of cession is
// recognised twice. Booking optimistically has to mean booking the RECOVERABLE
// optimistically too: the pool gives back cede(drawn) - cede(marked) at
// inception and earns it back as the unwind restores the claims. Then
//
//     total = cede(drawn) + G + (-G) + lognormal = cede(drawn) + lognormal
//
// which carries no reference to the bias at all, in either arm.
//
// ⚠ THE MARKDOWN IS PROPORTIONAL ACROSS THE WHOLE REGISTER, and the unwind must
// reverse it the same way. Sending the unwind to the developing set instead would
// restore three claims past their drawn values while the rest stayed marked
// down — the original defect with extra steps.
