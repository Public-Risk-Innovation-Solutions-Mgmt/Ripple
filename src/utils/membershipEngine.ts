// They solved a capture rate k from MEMBERSHIP_EQUILIBRIUM_ENROLLMENT by
// requiring expected joins to equal expected departures at N* = 63:
//
//     k = (N* x d - adj) / (roster - N*)
//
// which made the book a quantity the model STEERED TOWARD rather than an
// outcome. Every measurement taken against that system — that growth was
// unreachable at any cap, that intake ran 2.6/yr against withdrawals of
// 2.65-2.94 — was a measurement of the target, not of the mechanism.
//
// WHAT REPLACES IT: nothing on the demand side. Intake is now entirely supply:
// a share of the unenrolled marketplace applies, the appetite bar filters them,
// and everyone who clears is written up to the capacity guard. Departures stay
// proportional to the book. The two flows cross where
//
//     APPLICATION_RATE x (roster - N)  =  N x (1 - retention)
//
// and that crossing is an OUTCOME of two independent rates rather than a
// constant. A book that settles there is two flows meeting; a book that settles
// at 63 would mean something is still steering, which is the discriminator
// new-business-appetite-derive reports against.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ AND THE PRICE CHANNEL INTO RECRUITMENT IS DARK FROM THIS COMMIT. Ruled
// deliberately, not overlooked.
//
// newMemberAdjustment below carried price, satisfaction, surplus, assessment
// and risk-control into the join count. Its scale is in MEMBERS PER YEAR —
// absolute, and netted against k so that all-defaults came out neutral — so it
// cannot be reused as a multiplier on an application rate without being
// re-measured from scratch. Re-measuring it against a system that is still
// moving would mean measuring it twice.
//
// So it is retired here and returns with the market derivation, which
// satisfaction needs anyway. AT DEFAULTS THE LOSS IS NEAR ZERO — the price term
// reads levelDeviationPct, which is ~0 at defaults — but A PLAYER WHO PRICES
// LOW NO LONGER ATTRACTS MEMBERS, and that is a live lever going dark for a
// commit. Named here so it is restored rather than rediscovered.
// ============================================================================

// ⚠ newMemberAdjustment AND calcExpectedNewMembers ARE DELETED WITH THE TARGET.
// See the block above for why the ladder cannot simply be re-pointed at the
// application rate, and for what goes dark in the meantime.
//
// ⚠ AND THE DELETION TOOK TWO CONSTANTS WITH IT THAT THE PLAN DID NOT NAME.
// MEMBER_MOVEMENT_WEIGHTS.attraction (six weights) and RATE_LEVEL_SENSITIVITY
// had this ladder as their ONLY engine consumer. Both are now dormant: still
// exported, still rendered on the Calculation Audit page, acting on nothing.
// They are kept as data because they return with the market derivation, and
// they are marked dormant at their definitions rather than left to read as
// live. MEMBER_MOVEMENT_WEIGHTS.retention is untouched — departure still reads
// it, and that is the half of the object that still does work.

// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THIS STOCK IS QUANTISED ONTO A GRID THE SAME SIZE AS ITS OWN ANNUAL MOVE,
// AND THAT IS A DEFECT. RECORDED HERE BECAUSE A LATER VOLUNTARY-DEPARTURE
// MECHANISM WILL WANT TO READ THIS QUANTITY AND WOULD BE READING A STAIRCASE.
//
// The return rounds to ONE DECIMAL, and `current` is therefore always already
// 1-dp. So a year's delta either clears 0.05 and moves the stock by a whole
// 0.1, or clears nothing and is discarded entirely. Nothing accumulates: the
// result is re-quantised every year, so a sub-step delta is not saved up, it is
// lost.
//
// MEASURED, 8 games x 14 years at defaults, where delta is
// -changeDeviationPct x RATE_SATISFACTION_SENSITIVITY:
//
//   line       mean |delta|   as a share of the 0.05 step   year-pairs that moved
//   WC            0.0425                0.85x                   30 of 104

//
// ⚠ SO IT IS NOT INERT, AND "INERT BY CONSTRUCTION" IS THE WRONG DIAGNOSIS —
// IT WAS THE OBVIOUS ONE AND THE MEASUREMENT DOES NOT SUPPORT IT. The stock
// takes 17-20 distinct values over a run and drifts -0.22 (WC) across fourteen
// years. The signal gets through about three years in ten.
//
// THE ACTUAL DEFECT IS ATTENUATION AND LUMPINESS, WHICH IS WORSE THAN INERTNESS
// BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS WORKING. The response is nonlinear in the input:
// a year at 0.04 transmits zero and a year at 0.06 transmits 0.1, so the stock
// over-responds to the years that cross and ignores the rest. A player making a
// small, sustained pricing change sees nothing for several years and then a
// jump, and neither is proportional to what they did.
//
// ⚠ AND THE CODEBASE ALREADY KNOWS THE RIGHT GRID. The joiner's own opening
// satisfaction, drawn ~200 lines below, is stored to TWO decimals with a note
// saying one decimal "would quantise a joiner's opening onto a coarser grid
// than the thing it feeds". That argument applies here verbatim and this site
// did not get it.
//
// NOT FIXED IN THIS COMMIT, DELIBERATELY. Changing the rounding moves this
// stock, which feeds calcRetentionProbability, which is the thing being
// switched off — so it would be a behavioural change folded into a commit whose
// point is that the behaviour is suspended. It belongs with the derived
// voluntary mechanism, where the stock's grid can be chosen against what that
// mechanism needs to read rather than against nothing.
//
// ⚠ ONE TRAP FOR WHOEVER PICKS THIS UP: THERE ARE TWO SATISFACTIONS AND ONLY
// THIS ONE IS ON THE COARSE GRID. memberSatisfaction.ts's per-member stock moves
// in hundredths and is stored to two decimals; this pool-level scalar is the one
// calcRetentionProbability reads, and it is the one quantised. Measuring the
// per-member module's drift and concluding this term is fine would be reading
// the wrong quantity.

  // IDENTICAL to before this commit — take the first 9 and then the first 3 of
  // those, and you have the first 3. It also means the appetite tier no longer
  // perturbs the RNG stream at all: every arm shuffles the same array to the
  // same order, and only the filter downstream differs. Comparing two tiers is
  // therefore comparing two decisions on one game rather than two games.
  //
  // ⚠ THE APPLICATION COUNT IS DETERMINISTIC AND THE VARIANCE IS IN WHO APPLIES.
  // A noisy count would need its own draw and would move every downstream
  // stream; it is not needed. With ~9 applicants and roughly a third clearing
  // the strict bar, the number eligible is already binomial with a standard
  // deviation near 1.4, which is where short years come from.

  // availableMembers is the marketplace minus the enrolled, the shuffle runs
  // over it, applicationCount is a share of it, and this map runs once per
  // joiner. Freeze the roster and all four change. Keeping the sites live
  // avoids a SECOND, gratuitous divergence; it cannot avoid the first, and the
  // first is the change itself.
