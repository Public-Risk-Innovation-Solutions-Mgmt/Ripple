// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THIS IS A REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION, NOT THE PRICING PATH. READ THIS FIRST.
//
// S3 does NOT price off this file. The pool already had a triangle —
// LinePoolState.reserveDevelopment, an append-only ledger of its own played
// accident years on both bases — and that is what experienceRating.ts prices
// off. This module builds a SECOND, SYNTHETIC ten-year history from the member
// catalog, which the pool never lived.
//
// ⚠ AND THE REASON IS A CORRECTION TO THIS FILE'S OWN HEADER. The note below
// says the factors here become true of the played game once PER_CLAIM_REVISION
// flips. That was wrong. Matching the development PROCESS was necessary but not
// sufficient: the engine also has to PRODUCE development, and its law is
// MEAN-ONE, so E[terminal] = E[initial] and the played incurred triangle is
// flat (cumulative 0.9857 / 0.9912 / 1.0005) after the flip exactly as before
// it. This triangle develops only because developmentDrift is applied HERE, and
// nothing in src/ outside this file applies it — so GL's synthetic cumulative
// of 3.60 stands against a played 0.9912.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS NOW UNUSED, NOT MERELY UNCALLED. RULED: the ten-year rolling
// window seeds from reserveDevelopment, NOT from this file. Recorded here rather
// than only at the gate, because "reference implementation" reads as a thing
// with a pending consumer and this no longer has one.
//
// THE REASON IS A CLOCK MISMATCH, and it is the whole of the reason. This file
// compounds developmentDrift to each CLAIM's own closure age; the engine
// compounds it to the COHORT's IBNER_HORIZON (WC 5-12, GL 3-8, Property 2-4).
// Same cumulative by construction, DIFFERENT AGE-TO-AGE SHAPE. Seeding a window
// from here and extending it by play would make a chain ladder average two
// patterns, and that average is a pattern no book produces. reserveDevelopment
// has no such problem: it carries 7-8 rows at game start as a proper staircase
// (ay-4 at age 1, ay-5 at age 2, ... ay-8 at age 5), passes ten within two or
// three played years, and every factor in it is ENGINE-produced — seeded rows
// included, because runPriorHistory calls processYear. Consistent end to end.
//
// ⚠ WHAT WOULD BRING IT BACK, precisely: re-solve this file's drift against the
// HORIZON so its age-to-age shape matches the engine's — the same re-solve
// TRIANGLE_DEVELOPMENT_DRIFT_HORIZON already performed on the engine side, and
// which defaultAssumptions records as MUST-CLOSE before any ten-year seed lands.
// Until that is done, nothing here may be seeded into a priced triangle.
//
// ⚠ WHY IT IS STILL KEPT. Its generator is the blueprint for making the ENGINE
// develop incurred: it draws an INITIAL estimate and walks it forward to a
// terminal landing on the severity fit, verified at 2.052 / 2.141 / 1.619. That
// blueprint was USED — forward booking is built on it, and measured on the
// flagged arm the engine now develops incurred within horizon at 1.1041 /
// 1.2599 / 1.1584. So this file has already paid for itself as a design
// document. It is not dead code, it is not a fifth ledger mechanism, and it is
// not a pricing input.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE PRICING TRIANGLE — S1. NOTHING READS THIS YET.
//
// ⚠ PRICING_TRIANGLE.enabled IS FALSE AND NOTHING IN src/ CALLS THIS MODULE.
// The pool still prices off the held pure premium exactly as before; this file
// has one consumer, triangle-check.ts, and both standing gates are byte-identical
// against the parent. When the flag flips, `currentPurePremiumPer100` reads a
// developed triangle instead of a constant — that is S3, not this commit.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND WHY IT COULD NOT BE MEASURED BEFORE IT EXISTED.
//
// The pool is to price off its own experience: ten accident years, each at its
// OWN maturity, developed to ultimate with selected factors. Measured on the
// SHIPPED engine, that is impossible — the incurred triangle there is flat.
// Age-to-age factors read 0.992 to 1.002 on all three lines against the pool's
// own GL experience of 1.872 / 1.439 / 1.265 / 1.031 / 1.024, because a cohort
// is booked AT its register sum on day one (bookingBias is 0.80 x max(0, 1-CLF)
// and the shipped default CLF is exactly 1.000) and then developed by a mean-one
// factor. A chain ladder on it returns the truth: 1.001 / 0.999 / 1.002.
//
// ⚠ SO THE TRIANGLE IS NOT A VIEW OF THE EXISTING PATH. It is a second claim
// draw with a different generation order, and that difference IS the mechanism.
//
// ============================================================================
// FORWARD DEVELOPMENT, AND THE ULTIMATE IS NOT KNOWN AT GENERATION.
//
// The shipped generators draw an ULTIMATE and the engine develops it with a
// mean-one factor, so the ultimate is known at inception and the development is
// noise around it. Here a claim is drawn as an INITIAL ESTIMATE and walked
// forward; where it lands is not known when it is written. That is the whole
// point and it is what makes a factor selection meaningful: there is something
// genuinely unobserved at the valuation date.
//
// ⚠ THE INITIAL DISTRIBUTION IS DERIVED, NOT FITTED, AND THE ARITHMETIC IS
// TESTABLE. Development is a variance ADDED in log space, so
//
//     Var[ln terminal] = Var[ln initial] + Var[ln development] + 2Cov
//
// and the severity fit becomes the TERMINAL target rather than the draw. Solving
// for the initial spread gives the contraction at
// TRIANGLE_INITIAL_CONTRACTION: initial = A x drawn^k. See that constant for
// the solve, the per-line development variances behind it, and why GL's figure
// was NOT carried across to the other two lines.
//
// ⚠ THE MEAN IS PRESERVED AND THAT IS NOT COSMETIC. The triangle is read as a
// LOSS COST. The development law is mean-one, so E[terminal] = E[initial], and
// A is solved to hold E[initial] = E[drawn] exactly — measured at 1.00000 on
// every line. Contracting the log spread WITHOUT re-centring would move the
// mean by exp((1-k^2) sigma^2 / 2), which on GL is a factor of 1.5.
