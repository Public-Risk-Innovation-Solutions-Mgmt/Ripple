// ============================================================================
// THE UNDERWRITING DEPARTMENT'S MEMO — who wants in, and who would go.
//
// INFORMATIONAL, NOT A CONTROL. The same division Claims already draws: the
// LISTING is a department page, the THRESHOLD is a decision on the Decisions
// tab. There is no per-applicant accept or decline here and this must not grow
// one — the pool underwrites against a standard, it does not work a queue.
//
// ⚠ ONE PAGE PER LINE, TWO SECTIONS, AND THE ONE PAGE IS THE POINT. A player
// should be able to see that they are turning away a candidate with a better
// loss run than a member they are renewing. Split across two documents that
// comparison disappears, so both sections carry the SAME columns even where one
// side could carry more — see the column note below.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ "WHO WANTS IN" IS A CANDIDATE LIST, NOT THIS YEAR'S APPLICANTS, AND THE
// DIFFERENCE IS NOT COSMETIC — THIS YEAR'S APPLICANTS DO NOT EXIST TO BE SHOWN.
//
// WHICH members apply is DRAWN inside processYear: membershipEngine shuffles the
// available pool and takes a prefix (`shuffledPool.slice(0, applicationCount)`).
// Only `applicantCount` survives onto the result — the ids are never stored, on
// the same rule declined members follow. So before a year is locked the
// applicant identities do not exist, and after it is locked they are gone.
// DecisionsPage's own header says the same thing about the appetite tiles:
// "share x applications is the expected eligible count, NOT this year's actual".
//
// What this section lists instead is the AVAILABLE POOL — the marketplace, minus
// the enrolled, minus anyone inside the re-enrolment cooldown. That is the set
// the threshold actually acts on, it is a pure filter rather than a draw, and it
// is therefore the same on every render of the same game state. A drawn list
// would not be reproducible and could not be fingerprinted at all.
//
// ⚠ SO THE ROW COUNT IS NOT THE JOINER COUNT, AND THE PAGE SAYS SO TWICE. Both
// numbers are printed in the section's opening line: how many COULD apply, and
// how many are EXPECTED to. A reader who counts the rows and expects that many
// joiners is reading it wrong, and the heading is written to stop them.
//
// ⚠ AND THE ORDER IS NEUTRAL ON PURPOSE. Sorted BY NAME, not best-to-worst.
// Sorting by loss ratio would imply a ranking the engine does not perform:
// applicants are written in the order they come, and the pool underwrites
// against a standard rather than cherry-picking the queue. A page that ranks
// them teaches the opposite of the mechanic. "Who would go" is sorted by name
// too, so the two sections read the same way and neither implies a priority.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE COLUMNS ARE THE SAME ON BOTH SIDES, AND TWO ASKED-FOR COLUMNS ARE NOT
// HERE. Claim count and a ">$1M" flag were both wanted. Neither can be shown
// for a candidate, at all:
//
//   MemberLossYear carries exactly five fields — yearNumber, actual,
//   expectedAtOwnRq, expectedAtManual, primaryActual. No claim count, no
//   per-claim amounts. Per-claim data exists ONLY in the pool's own register
//   (LineResultSet.claims), which covers enrolled members; a prospect's claims
//   are generated and then discarded, because they "feed nothing" but history.
//
// They could have been shown for MEMBERS alone. They are not, because a member
// row carrying a claim count and $1M flags beside a candidate row carrying
// neither is not a comparison — and the comparison is the reason both sections
// share a page. Dropped for symmetry, not omitted by oversight.
//
// ⚠ AND primaryActual IS NOT A $1M MARKER. actual - primaryActual is non-zero
// whenever a year contained a claim over EXPERIENCE_SPLIT_POINT, which is
// $25,000 — the experience split, not a retention. It says nothing about
// whether the tower paid, so it is not used as a stand-in for the flag that was
// wanted.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS SHOWN INSTEAD OF A RATIO COLUMN PER ROW. The window ratio the
// threshold acts on is over EXPERIENCE_MOD.windowYears, currently 3. The loss
// run prints FIVE years because LOSS_HISTORY_CAP_YEARS stores five, and the two
// extra years are the interesting part: a candidate can look clean on the bar's
// three-year window and carry a terrible fourth year the bar cannot see. The
// per-year A/E is printed so that gap is visible rather than implied.
