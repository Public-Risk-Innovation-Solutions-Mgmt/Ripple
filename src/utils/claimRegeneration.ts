// CLAIM REGENERATION — redraw a past line-year and get exactly what was drawn.
//
// Ruling 8 keeps the claim register out of persistence. Until da011f5 that was
// false by accident (the register WAS saved, and it blew the localStorage quota
// at year 4); since da011f5 it is true by stripping; and from this file it is
// true BY DESIGN — a save carries the inputs, and the register is redrawn from
// them on demand. Store the inputs, not the output.
//
// ⚠ "SEED x MEMBER x YEAR" WAS NEVER ENOUGH, AND FOUR COMMENTS SAID IT WAS.
// Measured: the same seed with one pool-wide risk-control decision changed moves
// GL's AY1 register from 321 claims / $27.375M to 310 / $26.986M. A line-year's
// draw also depends on the ENROLLED ROSTER, the mix correction k, the year's
// rcEffectiveness, GL's shared gPool, and any shock effects in force. All of
// those are functions of the decision path, not of the seed.
//
// ⚠ ONE NUMBER HAD TO BE STORED, AND ONLY ONE. Tracing each input to where it lives:
//
//   roster                  LineResultSet.memberList — the SAME array the
//                           generator was handed (memberResult.activeMembers)
//   k                       LineResultSet.kLineApplied
//   pre-game seed offset    LineResultSet.pregameAttempt — the bootstrap's
//                           accepted redraw attempt; effective seed is
//                           (seed + attempt x 997). Stamped by priorHistoryEngine
//                           for exactly this use, before this file existed.
//   rcEffectiveness         LineResultSet.rcEffectivenessApplied — ADDED FOR
//                           THIS. The only rc anywhere was the line STATE's
//                           rolling current value, overwritten each year; a
//                           past year's applied value was not recorded.
//   calendarYear, year      on the ResultSet
//   gPool                   poolYearFactor(seed, year) — a pure function
//   shock effects           resolveShocks(instance, year) — consumes no
//                           randomness; instance.scheduledShocks is never
//                           mutated after creation
//
// So of the inputs a redraw needs, THREE were already there (roster, k, and the
// pre-game attempt), ONE had to be added (rc, a single number per line-year),
// and two are derivable —
// and a derivable value stored would be a second copy of one fact. The save
// grows by roughly 3 x 13 x 8 bytes. (The first draft of this header said
// nothing needed adding; typecheck disagreed, and it was right.)
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ A REDRAW THAT IS NOT EXACT IS WORSE THAN NO REDRAW, because it is silent.
// Every consumer would read plausible claims that were never drawn. So:
//
//   - the argument mapping is SHARED with the engine (claimGeneration.ts), not
//     re-implemented here, so the two cannot drift apart;
//   - save-round-trip-check regenerates every line-year of a restored game and
//     compares it to the straight-through arm CLAIM BY CLAIM ON EVERY FIELD —
//     ids, amounts, components, occurrence grouping — never on totals, which
//     can agree while the register underneath differs;
//   - that gate carries its own positive control: it perturbs one input and
//     asserts the redraw DIFFERS, so the comparison is known to have teeth;
//   - a result that cannot be reproduced THROWS. A save written before
//     `kLineApplied` existed has no k to redraw with, and defaulting to 1 would
//     produce a plausible, wrong register with no symptom — the failure this
//     file exists to prevent, reintroduced as a fallback.
//
// WHO CALLS THIS, AND WHO MUST NOT. The claims workbook and anything else that
// reads a register the save dropped. NOT the engine's live path: processYear
// has the claims it just drew, and a second code path producing the same
// objects is how two views of one fact drift.
