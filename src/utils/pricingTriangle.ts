// ============================================================================
// THE PRICING TRIANGLE — the pool's ten-year rolling history, PROJECTED.
//
// ⚠ DERIVED, NOT STORED. Every figure here is a pure function of
// LinePoolState.reserveDevelopment plus the roster and membership history, all
// of which the save already carries. `pricingTriangle` is therefore in
// SAVE_STRIPPED_KEYS and is rebuilt by processYear on the far side of a reload,
// exactly as LineResultSet.claims is rebuilt by claimRegeneration. Ruling 8's
// principle — store the inputs, not the output — applies unchanged, and it is
// why this commit adds no field the round trip has to carry or assert.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ IT SEEDS FROM reserveDevelopment AND NOT FROM claimTriangle.ts. Ruled, and
// the reason is a clock mismatch: the generator compounds developmentDrift to
// each CLAIM's closure age, the engine to the COHORT's IBNER_HORIZON. Same
// cumulative by construction, different age-to-age shape, and a chain ladder
// over both averages a pattern no book produces. See claimTriangle.ts's header.
//
// Measured depth, mean rows per line, flagged arm, 8 games:
//
//   played year        0     1     2     3     4     6    10
//   WC               6.5   7.5   8.5   9.5  10.5  12.5  16.5    reaches 10 at year 4
//   GL               7.0   8.0   9.0  10.0  11.0  13.0  17.0    reaches 10 at year 3
//   Property         7.5   8.5   9.5  10.5  11.5  13.5  17.5    reaches 10 at year 3
//
// ⚠ THAT CORRECTS "SEVEN TO EIGHT ROWS, TEN WITHIN TWO OR THREE PLAYED YEARS",
// which is written in two headers from the previous commit. WC opens at 6.5 and
// takes FOUR played years, not two or three. The window is therefore short on
// every line for the first three years and shortest on WC — pricing runs on a
// partial window before it runs on a full one, which is a real property of the
// opening game rather than a warm-up to be hidden.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE WINDOW RULE — A FIXED TEN ACCIDENT YEARS. THE OLDEST DROPS, EVERY YEAR.
//
// ⚠ AND ON WC THAT RETIRES ACCIDENT YEARS THAT ARE STILL DEVELOPING. INTENDED.
// The alternative rule — drop what has run off — was considered and refused. A
// ratemaking window is ten years because that is the window, not because the
// claims inside it are finished. What sits beyond it is the unobserved tail,
// and estimating that tail is the problem this whole design is about; a window
// that waited for closure would hand the pool a triangle with no tail to
// estimate and no reason to prefer one method over another.
//
// The two rules pick different cells because reserveDevelopment is append-only
// and never prunes — WC seeded rows are still being valued at age 23.
//
// ⚠ THE ASYMMETRY IS THE MECHANISM, AND IT IS ONE LINE'S. Unpaid share of
// ultimate at the moment the window drops a year, value-weighted, flagged arm:
//
//   line       age 1    age 4    age 8   age 10   age 12
//   WC         54.8%    42.9%    29.7%    23.9%    18.3%
//   GL         79.1%    33.4%     3.9%     0.4%        -
//   Property   38.3%    14.1%     1.2%     0.2%        -
//
// So the window truncates roughly a QUARTER of WC's value and essentially none
// of GL's or Property's — a ratio of about 60x and 120x. GL develops violently
// and finishes early; WC develops mildly and finishes late. One line has a tail
// the pool must estimate and two do not, and that is the difference the method
// selection is supposed to be about.
//
// ⚠ THE 23.9% CORRECTS A FIGURE OF 43.6% CARRIED INTO THIS COMMIT'S BRIEF, and
// GL/Property read 0.4%/0.2% rather than 0.1%. The direction and the mechanism
// survive intact; the magnitude on WC is about half what was stated. Recorded
// because the window rule rests on it.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ AGES ARE 1-BASED HERE AND 0-BASED IN reserveDevelopment. DELIBERATE, AND IT
// IS THE ONLY PLACE THE TWO CONVENTIONS MEET.
//
// A newly written accident year is registered with ageAtFirstValuation: 0, so
// at the end of its own year it sits at LEDGER AGE 0. A triangle's first
// development period is age 1 — twelve months — by every actuarial convention,
// and the acceptance test's condition 1 says "the played year is present at
// AGE 1". Both are right; they are different clocks. triangle age = ledger age
// + 1, converted here and nowhere else.

 * derivations.ts built the funding panel's basis as
 * `rows: lineState.reserveDevelopment ?? []`, unwindowed, so the panel priced
 * off the pool's WHOLE history while the engine priced off ten years. Measured
 * over 8 games x 12 years x 3 lines, unwindowed against windowed:

 *
 * The ledger is longer than the window in EVERY line-year from year one — WC
 * opens with 14 seeded rows against a window of 10 — so this was not a late-game
 * edge, it was every game from the first decision. A leading underscore of doubt
 * about which rows to pass is what a named builder removes.
 *
 * ⚠ IT IS FOR A CLOSED STATE AND THE ENGINE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CALL IT. The
 * engine assembles its basis mid-year from `ctx`, whose roster is the one being
 * moved, and re-pointing it at `poolState` would change what it prices. What
 * makes this helper trustworthy is not that the engine shares it but that it
 * PROVABLY REPRODUCES IT: computed from the pool state at the close of year N,
 * `experienceRatePer100` over this basis equals the engine's own
 * `netPurePremiumPer100` for year N+1 EXACTLY — 42 of 42 line-years to 1e-9,
 * across a fourteen-year game on all three lines. That identity is the whole
 * reason the indication can be shown a year ahead of being charged.
