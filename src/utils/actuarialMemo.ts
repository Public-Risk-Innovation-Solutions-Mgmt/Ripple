// THE ACTUARIAL MEMORANDUM — the reserve development exhibit.
//
// One row per accident year, oldest first, showing how this pool's ESTIMATE of
// that year's ultimate loss has moved since it was first booked.
//
// ⚠ ULTIMATE, NOT INCURRED, AND THE WORD IS LOAD-BEARING. Friedland reserves
// "reported claims" for paid plus case outstanding. This exhibit is about the
// GAP between that reported figure and the estimate of where the year finally
// lands, so using the ambiguous word exactly where the distinction is the point
// would defeat the exhibit. Every figure here is an estimate of ultimate, net
// of reinsurance, on the same basis as the reserve rollforward.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SHOW: the true ultimate (registerSum) and the
// booking bias. The player sees the estimate develop and works out the cause.
// Printing the bias would hand over the answer to the only question the exhibit
// asks. The single exception is at GAME END, where the un-emerged deficiency is
// disclosed — the game is over and the reveal is the point.
//
// ⚠ SIGN CONVENTION, STATED BECAUSE THE ENGINE'S IS THE OPPOSITE. Here a
// POSITIVE development means the estimate ROSE — adverse. The engine's
// `developmentImpact` is positive for FAVOURABLE development (it is subtracted
// from incurred), which is right for that arithmetic and wrong for a reader:
// an actuary reading a development exhibit expects adverse to be positive. The
// two are negatives of each other and the memo says so in prose.

  // this project produces most, and making the RATIO gross needed a second
  // stored series for its denominator — which took cohort-stock-check's
  // poolState growth ratio from 0.65 to 0.76 against a 0.75 limit. So the
  // exhibit is net throughout: every cell here is subtractable against every
  // other, and paidToIncurred is netPaid over netUltimate with no conversion in

  // The claims workbook is GROSS throughout for the same reason in reverse. The

  // WHY THE RATIO IS WORTH A COLUMN: it is what says whether an accident year is
  // nearly settled or still moving, and it only became informative once the
  // payout patterns made the three lines differ — before them every line paid
  // down at one rate and the ratio carried no per-line signal. Net Paid Losses is
  // one calendar-year total per line, so nothing anywhere showed a year-one GL
  // accident year sitting at 10% paid.

  // WHATEVER THE READER HAD SELECTED. Every other figure in this memo moves
  // with asAtYear; this one field did not, because it counted current cohort
  // state rather than walking the movement series. Measured on a seven-year
  // game it printed 778 at every selection against true counts of 440 / 493 /
  // 557 / 608 / 664 / 721 / 778 — out by 77% at year 1 and converging only at
  // the latest valuation, which is the single year actuarial-memo-check tested.
  // The count is now summed over the steps that had landed by asAtYear; see
  // countDevelopedOccurrences, which also carries the $1,000 floor and the
  // measurement behind it.

  // to the latest valuation and says so at the head, and this sentence must be
  // the same year as the exhibit above it.

  // THE INDICATION — what the triangle above says the NEXT year costs.
  //
  // ⚠ IT IS FILED ONLY AT THE LATEST VALUATION, and that is the same discipline
  // lastValuation() already applies to the exhibit. An indication is a statement
  // about the triangle AS IT STANDS; printing one under a back-dated heading
  // would date it to a year whose triangle is not the one it was computed from.
  // When the reader has selected an earlier valuation, the section says where to
  // find it rather than recomputing a historical indication nobody charged.
  //
  // ⚠ EVERY FIGURE HERE IS RETAINED LOSS COST PER $100, ON ONE BASIS, AND THAT
  // IS THE POINT OF READING netPurePremiumPer100 RATHER THAN purePremiumPer100.
  // The triangle is built on ReserveDevelopmentRow, whose ultimate and paid
  // series are both NET of reinsurance, so what it indicates is a RETAINED loss
  // cost. `purePremiumPer100` on the result is GROSS. Putting the indication
  // beside the gross figure would be a basis mismatch of exactly the family this
  // project has retracted more findings to than any other — and it would print
  // a movement that is mostly the reinsurance programme. pricingTriangle's own
  // header states the pairing: "it is netPurePremiumPer100 that equals this,
  // not purePremiumPer100".
  //
  // NOTHING BELOW IS RECOMPUTED. The charged figure is read off the locked
  // result; the indication comes from the one basis builder; the load comes from
  // the one CLF dispatch the funding panel uses.
