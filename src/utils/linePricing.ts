// THE RATE STACK — ONE definition, called by the engine and by the Decisions
// panel that explains it.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. The panel used to re-derive the price from its own
// formulas and claimed, in a comment, to use "the SAME formulas
// simulationEngine.ts actually prices with". That claim decayed silently twice:
//
//   NET FUNDING       the engine subtracts expected ceded before the CLF; the
//                     panel did not. GL's pool premium rate read $5.63 on the
//                     Decisions screen against the engine's $3.26 — 73% high,
//                     on the screen where the decision is made.
//   TOWER PRICING     the engine prices WC/GL per layer off measured expected
//                     ceded loss; the panel charged the (now-retired)
//                     REINSURANCE_PROGRAMS' percentage of premium, a
//                     structure those lines left.
//
// Both were invisible for the worst possible reason: the panel's combined ratio
// was internally consistent ON ITS OWN GROSS BASIS and read 100.0%, and when
// the engine's own combined-ratio basis was fixed it also became 100.0%. The
// two agreed on the single summary number anyone would have checked while every
// component underneath differed.
//
// So the fix is not a third parallel definition kept in step by discipline. The
// engine and the panel now call THIS function, and parity is structural rather
// than asserted. scripts/diagnostics/panel-engine-parity-check.ts still asserts
// it component by component — never on the combined ratio, which is exactly the
// check that would have passed throughout.
// ============================================================================
//
// ⚠ THE CLF IS AN INPUT, DELIBERATELY. Resolving it needs lookupCLF, which
// lives in simulationEngine, and importing that here would make a cycle. Both
// callers already resolve it the same way — the engine via its selectedFundingCLF
// dispatch, the panel via fundingConsequence's clfFor — and the parity harness
// covers the pair, so passing it in costs nothing and keeps this module a leaf.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS THE PRE-MOVEMENT QUOTE. It answers "what would this year cost on
// the book as it stands", which is the question the panel asks and the same one
// the engine asks to build the price signal members respond to. The engine's
// FINAL premium re-runs the same arithmetic on the POST-movement book, so it
// differs by whoever joins or leaves — see the parity harness, which measures
// that residual rather than pretending it is zero.

// ============================================================================
// THE GROSS-UP — turning a RETAINED loss cost into the GROSS rate this module's
// contract requires.
//
// ⚠ WHY IT EXISTS. `purePremiumPer100` is documented GROSS and every consumer
// depends on that: `expectedLoss` (the aggregate's own attachment basis and the
// reserve basis), the admin base, and the net-funding subtraction below. The
// held rate satisfies that contract. The EXPERIENCE rate does not: it is
// chain-laddered off ReserveDevelopmentRow, whose `ultimateByValuation` and
// `paidByValuation` are BOTH NET of reinsurance (see the ⚠ at paidByValuation),
// so it is already a retained rate. Handing it to the subtraction unconverted
// removed cession a SECOND time.
//
// ⚠ WHY A FIXED POINT RATHER THAN A SKIPPED SUBTRACTION. Skipping the
// subtraction on the experience path would leave two pricing paths differing by
// basis — the class of defect that produced this one — and would leave
// `expectedLoss` net while its own comment says it stays gross, which is the
// aggregate stop-loss's attachment basis. Grossing up keeps ONE path: the rate
// is gross wherever it is read, and the subtraction happens exactly once, in
// the place it always did.
//
// ⚠ THE FACTOR IS NOT A CONSTANT AND IS NOT FITTED. It is the solution of
//     g - expectedCededPer100For(g) = retained
// solved against the very function the subtraction calls, so the two are
// inverse by construction and cannot drift apart. The occurrence tower's ceded
// does not depend on the rate at all (occurrenceProgramCost reads only the book
// and the year), so on GL — which has no aggregate — this lands on the exact
// additive answer g = retained + ceded immediately. WC and Property need a solve
// because their aggregate sits on the year's retained LOSS DISTRIBUTION, whose
// mean is the gross rate less what the occurrence layers cede — so what the
// aggregate expects to pay moves with the rate even though its terms do not.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠⚠ AND THE EQUATION ONLY HAS A ROOT BECAUSE THE TOWER IS AGREED IN ADVANCE.
// THIS TOOK THREE ATTEMPTS AND THE FIRST TWO DIAGNOSES WERE BOTH WRONG. THE
// MEASUREMENTS ARE KEPT BECAUSE THE WRONG ONES ARE THE INSTRUCTIVE PART.
//
// ATTEMPT 1 — "linear with a small slope, so the map is a contraction." Linear
// was right. SMALL was never checked. The aggregate attaches at a multiple of
// expected RETAINED loss, so raising the gross rate raises the attachment and
// the aggregate cedes less, and the old solver was a fixed-point iteration
// `g <- retained + ceded(g)` that threw at twenty passes. That throw is the only
// reason any of this was found rather than shipped.
//
// ATTEMPT 2 — "the slope is -0.9995, so the iteration is a REFLECTION and needs
// a root-find rather than a fixed point." Measured on Property year 1 from a
// retained rate of 0.075812, the iterates orbit between 0.124334 and 0.126335,
// and across that cycle
//
//     d(ceded)/d(gross) = (0.048523 - 0.050523) / (0.126335 - 0.124334) = -0.9995
//
// ⚠ THAT NUMBER IS A CHORD ACROSS A DISCONTINUITY, NOT A DERIVATIVE, AND THE
// CONCLUSION DRAWN FROM IT WAS WRONG. Sampling h(g) = g - ceded(g) - retained on
// a fine grid through the same region shows what the two-cycle was really doing:
//
//     g=0.124331  ceded=0.050521  h=-0.002002
//     g=0.125848  ceded=0.051621  h=-0.001585
//     g=0.127364  ceded=0.049239  h=+0.002313    <-- h JUMPED THE ZERO
//
// ceded(g) was a SAWTOOTH — rising at about +0.72 and dropping ~0.0024 every
// 0.0075812 of g — so h was a rising staircase that stepped OVER zero and
// h(g) = 0 HAD NO ROOT AT ALL. The local behaviour was +0.72 with periodic
// drops; -0.9995 was the chord over one of the drops. No solver fixes a missing
// root, and the fixed-point was orbiting the gap rather than a reflection.
//
// ⚠ THE DROPS WERE THE CIRCULARITY. The aggregate's attachment was being
// recomputed from the very rate the solve was looking for, and
// propertyAggregate rounds it to whole millions (`Math.round(x / 1e6) * 1e6`,
// which is how attachments are actually written — BIN at $25k was chosen against
// exactly that convention). So each million the rounded attachment stepped, the
// treaty re-priced itself mid-solve and ceded fell off a cliff.
//
// ATTEMPT 3, AND THE ONE IN THE CODE — THE TOWER IS AGREED BEFORE THE YEAR.
// The attachment and the limit are set from what the pool already knows, the
// triangle's own estimate of RETAINED loss, and the rate is then solved once
// against fixed terms. That is what a real treaty is; an attachment that
// re-prices itself while the rate is being calculated is a modelling artefact.
// See `aggregateTermsRetainedPer100` on CessionBasis above, and quoteAggregate's
// header in reinsuranceTower.
//
// With the terms fixed, the drops are gone and only the +0.72 remains: ceded now
// rises CONTINUOUSLY and MONOTONICALLY with g, because a higher gross rate means
// a bigger loss distribution under an unchanged layer. So
//
//     h'(g) = 1 - ceded'(g) ~ +0.28
//
// h is continuous and strictly increasing, and the root exists and is unique.
//
// ⚠ THE $1M ROUNDING STAYS AND SO DOES BIN. Rounding to $25k would have shrunk
// the gap 40x and left the loop in place to return on a tower change, a
// different rate level, or another line. The circularity was the defect; the
// rounding was only where it bit.
//
// ⚠ SO THE SOLVER IS A SECANT ROOT-FIND ON h, AND IT IS KEPT EVEN THOUGH THE MAP
// WAS NEVER THE PROBLEM. It is the right solver for a continuous map, it needs
// no constant, and it is BIT-IDENTICAL to the old fixed-point iteration — max
// relative difference 0.000e+0 across 2844 solves — everywhere that one
// converged.
//
// ⚠ DAMPING WAS THE OBVIOUS FIX AND WAS ALWAYS THE WRONG ONE. Averaging
// successive iterates turns a slope of -1 into 0 and would have passed on the
// day, but it is tuned to a slope that was not even real, and it would have
// buried a discontinuity instead of removing it.
//
// The convergence assertion STAYS and still throws. A solver that quietly
// returns a rate nobody solved for is the failure this whole block exists to
// prevent.
