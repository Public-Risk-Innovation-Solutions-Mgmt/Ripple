// SHOCK RESOLUTION — pool level, once per year, before any line is processed.
//
// WHY IT LIVES AT POOL LEVEL. Events emit into MULTIPLE LINES FROM ONE CAUSE
// (#28 pandemic hits WC and GL; #2 would hit Property and WC). Every generator
// today is line-local — processLineYear only ever sees its own line — so the
// only correct home is processYear, which has all three lines in scope and
// already draws the shared gPool there for the same reason. Shocks are resolved
// here and per-line effects are PROJECTED DOWN through LineYearContext. A
// line-local generator must never reach across lines to discover a shock.
//
// THIS FUNCTION CONSUMES NO RANDOMNESS. That is not an implementation detail,
// it is the byte-identity guarantee. The explicit trigger path is a
// deterministic filter over a configured list, so there is no stream to open
// and therefore no stream to shift. When probability-based firing is added
// later it will open its OWN purpose-keyed label — deriveSubRng hashes the
// purpose string, so a new label cannot perturb an existing one — and it will
// populate the same ScheduledShock list that this function already reads.
// Everything downstream is unchanged by that addition.
//
// IT ALSO HOLDS NO STATE. Future-horizon persistence is recomputed every year
// as "fired in year <= N" rather than mutated onto the pool, so replaying any
// year from the instance alone gives the same answer. Determinism stays
// testable.
