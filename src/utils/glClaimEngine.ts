// General Liability claim-level loss generator — REBUILT onto a fitted
// per-claim 3-component lognormal mixture. See GL_LOSS_MODEL in
// defaultAssumptions.ts for the full rationale and an inventory of what this
// rebuild deleted (sub-coverages, the liability gate, litigation stages,
// GL_SOCIAL_INFLATION, the statutory cap, multi-claimant abuse batches).
//
// Same architecture as WC (wcClaimEngine.ts is the template), narrower now
// that the gate and batches are gone:
// 1. ONE BASIS: generateGlClaims (draw) and expectedGlGrossLossForKLine
//    (analytic on the draw's own basis) are a matched pair; GL's pure premium
//    derives from expectedGlGrossLossForPricing. See GlLossBasis for which
//    risk-quality channels each of the two sees, and why there are two.
// 2. RISK CONTROL HITS THE DRAW ONLY — absent from both expectations.
// 3. PURE PREMIUM HELD, k_GL ADAPTS — k_GL is GL's own normalizer, separate
//    from WC's, recomputed annually against the enrolled book. It neutralises
//    BOTH risk-quality channels, so the drawn expected loss equals the held
//    priced expectation whatever the book's RQ mix.
// 3b. SEVERITY IS CAPPED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE PAIR, AND THE CEILING IS FLAT.
//    glSeverityCap(year) = GL_SEVERITY_CAP ($84M, every year — no trend). The
//    draw clamps every claim; expectedClaimSeverity has NO uncapped code path
//    left. Because the ceiling no longer moves with the distribution, the
//    capped expectation grows STRICTLY SLOWER than glSeverityTrend again —
//    glCappedSeverityTrend is what pricing calls and is the ONLY correct year
//    factor; see its header for the mechanism and gl-claim-check.ts section 2c
//    for the measured gap.
// 4. DOLLAR VINTAGE IS THE ACCIDENT YEAR, ONCE. Severity is trended to the
//    accident year at the draw (glSeverityTrend) and frozen onto the claim.
//    GL has NO REPORT LAG — every claim reports in its own accident year — so
//    there is no emergence to re-value and no lag for the trend to compound
//    over. Frequency is FLAT and reads REAL payroll; the wage factor is a
//    rating/premium/display quantity only (see lineHelpers.getMemberExposure).
//
// OCCURRENCE == CLAIM, exactly like WC. GL's batch mechanism is deleted, not
// layered differently — see GL_LOSS_MODEL's header comment for why.

// GL SEVERITY TREND — wage inflation compounded with LONG-RUN social inflation.
//
//   wage inflation            3.63%   (see exposureTrend.ts for its derivation)
//   long-run social inflation 2.00%   JUDGMENT — see below
//   composed                  1.0363 x 1.0200 = 1.057026  ->  5.7026%/yr
//
// ⚠ COMPOSED MULTIPLICATIVELY, NOT SUMMED. Swiss Re define social inflation as
// severity growth BEYOND economic drivers — an additive excess as a CONCEPT —
// but the figures only reconcile as a product: 3.63 + 2.00 = 5.63, whereas
// 1.0363 x 1.020 = 1.057026. Summing the rates would understate the trend and
// break the rate-trend identity below.
//
// THE IDENTITY THAT MAKES THIS PAIR CORRECT: GL's rate is per $100 of NOMINAL
// payroll, so
//   rate trend = severityTrend / wageFactor = 1.057026 / 1.0363 = 1.0200
// exactly the social-inflation half. Payroll grows with the economic half,
// severity with both, and members feel the difference. Over a ten-year game
// (nine compounding periods) the rate rises x1.1951 and the member charge
// x1.6473, against WC's rate which stays flat.
//

// ===========================================================================
//
// SOURCED — Swiss Re Institute, sigma 4/2024, Social Inflation Index:
//   57% cumulative over the decade (4.6%/yr), 5.4%/yr average 2017-2022,
//   peaking at 7% in 2023. Social inflation observed since the 1980s, with
//   prior episodes in the 1980s and 2000s and the current one beginning in the
//   mid-2010s; the index has been above zero every year since 2014.
//
// ⚠ THE 2.0% IS A JUDGMENT, NOT A SWISS RE FIGURE. The 4.6%, 5.4% and 7.0%
// figures above are theirs; 2.0% is an estimate of a LONG-RUN AVERAGE ACROSS
// EPISODES AND QUIET PERIODS.
//
// WHY NOT USE 4.6% AS THE BASELINE. It is the CURRENT EPISODE'S average, not a
// long-run rate. Baking it in permanently asserts the episode never ends — and
// then the hard-market event (shockCatalog #19) adds another episode on top of
// it, double-counting. If the EVENT is the episode, the BASELINE has to be the
// between-episode rate. That is a structural argument, not a calibration one:
// it would hold even if the resulting numbers were convenient.
//
// WHAT WOULD DISPLACE IT: a social-inflation index covering the pre-2014
// period, or a public-entity liability severity trend from a rate filing.

// year-1 terms by year 10 (39% real-terms tightening) and broke the
// severity-scale invariance glClfGrid's interpolation axis depends on. Both
// objections were real and neither is refuted here — this is a DIFFERENT
// requirement (a claim ceiling that can be STATED, for a claims-export/worst-
// case-disclosure purpose) overriding a real cost, not a discovery that the
// cost was imaginary. See gl-claim-check.ts section 2c for what is now
// measured rather than asserted as a consequence, and glClfGrid.ts's header
// for why its LAMBDA axis (not CV) means the grid's own interpolation key

// happened, and is why nothing in this function needed to change for the
// re-pin above to price correctly. Written as the raw trend it would have been
// correct only by coincidence, and would have silently become the over-charge
// it exists to prevent. The cost is two normalCdf calls per year, memoized.
//
// ⚠ PRICING MUST USE THIS ONE. The engine prices GL as (held year-1 pure
// premium) x (year factor), and if that year factor were the RAW trend while
// the generator was capped nominally, the pool would charge for dollars the
// generator cannot produce — over-charging 2.2% by year 10 and 5.8% by year 20.
// That is finding 37's failure class with the sign reversed (price moving

// binds harder in later years, which is what a legal/practical ceiling does."

// silently shrank the modelled tail by 39% in real terms over ten years,
// changed the distribution's SHAPE, and broke the severity-scale invariance
// glClfGrid's interpolation axis depends on. Both of those costs were real.

// weighed: a ceiling that grows every year is one nobody can state as THE

// capped CV's drift) rather than assumed away. glClfGrid.ts's header explains
// why its own axis (claim count, not CV) is insulated from this specific
// regression regardless.
//
// The two limits still COMPOSE by min(), which is exactly

// The risk-quality-mix normaliser: expected loss if the enrolled book were all
// at neutral risk quality, over expected loss at its actual mix. Applied to
// lambda so that changing WHO is enrolled doesn't drift the pool's aggregate
// expected loss away from the held pick.
//
// BOTH SIDES USE THE k_GL BASIS, so the correction covers frequency theta AND
// the severity tilt. At neutral RQ the tilt is the identity, so the numerator is
// unaffected by it and the ratio measures exactly the mix effect.
//
// ⚠ THIS WAS THE DEFECT FOUND REVIEWING THE GL REBUILD, and the old comment
// here asserted the opposite of what the code did. Both sides used to call the
// PRICING basis, which is untilted — so the severity term cancelled out of the
// ratio and k_GL corrected FREQUENCY ONLY. The draw applied the tilt anyway, so
// it survived in losses with nothing offsetting it in price, and the drawn
// expected loss diverged from the held priced expectation by up to 26.6% as the
// book's RQ mix moved (measured: 3.0% at the observed enrolled book's mean RQ of
// 5.51, 11.2% at RQ 7). Because underwriting selection moves the book's mean RQ,
// a player who underwrote well earned a hidden margin that grew with their
// skill — where on WC the same skill lowers the PRICE and the loss ratio stays
// flat, which is the right lesson for a pool whose objective is affordable
// coverage rather than profit.
//

// rather than only at neutral, in gl-claim-check.ts: for any book,
