// THE LOSS PROVISION THE POOL PREMIUM ACTUALLY FUNDS — the numerator every

// inlined expression at each of its two call sites (line scope and pool
// aggregation).
//
// ⚠ WHY NOT expectedLoss. Since the net-funding change, poolPremium funds
// (gross expected - expected ceded) x CLF x rateLevel/100, while expectedLoss
// stays GROSS on purpose. Pairing gross expectedLoss with a denominator built
// on the net-funded poolPremium counts the ceded loss TWICE — once in the loss
// numerator and again as reinsuranceCost in the expense ratio — which is what
// pushed the Expected Combined Ratio to 130.0% on GL and 118.9% on WC while
// the pool was funding exactly its expected cost.
//
// ⚠ WHY DIVIDING BY THE CLF IS THE RIGHT INVERSION, and not merely convenient.
// poolPremium = exposure x netPurePremiumPer100 x CLF x pricingAdjustment x
// 10_000, so this returns net expected loss AT THE PRICED RATE LEVEL. That
// matters: the identity below has to close for any pricingAdjustment, not just
// the 1.0 it currently sits at, and re-deriving the net loss from the pure
// premium instead would drop the rate-level factor and reopen the gap the
// moment rateLevel moves off 100.
//
// THE IDENTITY THIS EXISTS TO PRESERVE. poolPremium + adminExpense +
// reinsuranceCost is identically totalMemberCharge, so at CLF 1.000 this
// numerator IS poolPremium and the Expected Combined Ratio is EXACTLY 1.0000 —
// not approximately. Above CLF 1.000 the shortfall below 1.0000 is the funding
// margin, which is the whole point of a confidence level. Asserted to float
// precision in scripts/diagnostics/ratio-basis-check.ts; if it stops closing
// exactly, this function or its callers are wrong.
//
// ⚠ THE PROPERTY CONTROL THIS NOTE RELIED ON IS GONE. It used to read
// "PROPERTY IS UNCHANGED BY CONSTRUCTION... Property is deliberately not
// netted, so its netPurePremiumPer100 IS its gross pure premium and this
// returns exactly the expectedLoss it already used. Property-solo must stay
// byte-identical." That was true of the expected-combined-ratio fix this
// function was written for, and it is what made that fix a diagnosis rather
// than a guess. It stopped being true when Property got its own occurrence
// layer: Property nets now, so this returns a genuinely net figure on all
// three lines and PR-solo is no longer a control for anything here.
// The function itself is unchanged and still correct — only the isolation

// x 5 years: enrolled-book neutral pure premium 6.7807 vs the held 6.8305, so
// the book is priced ~0.7% high, which moves the analytic gross loss ratio from
// 66.8% to 66.36% — inside tolerance.
// This is the PRICE of Correction 1, not a defect. Making the pure premium
// track the enrolled mix would rebuild exactly the pricing-chases-roster
// feedback loop Correction 1 exists to prevent: premium would fall as good
// risks left, which changes who leaves next year, and the loss ratio would

  // comment used to read "and the held rate is measurably heavy: against
  // realised ultimate loss cost on mature accident years, realised/held reads
  // WC 0.745, GL 0.585, Property 0.744." Those figures divide a NET realised

  // — by a GROSS held rate, so they measure the reinsurance programme and not
  // the held rate's adequacy. On a single basis — what the held arm CHARGES,
  // retained, against what its own accident years cost, retained —
  // experience-pricing-check's arm 1 reads 1.024 / 1.038 / 0.994. The held rate
  // is close to right, and "the held rate is itself heavy" was never a reason
  // to price off the triangle. The reason that survives is the one this project
  // actually wants — a pool that prices off its own developing experience
  // rather than off a constant.
  //
  // ⚠ WHAT STANDS IN FOR THE PROTECTION IS MEASUREMENT 3 AT PRICING_TRIANGLE.
  // THE FLAG IS ON — PRICING_TRIANGLE.enabled = true at defaultAssumptions.ts —
  // and this paragraph used to say it was off and must stay off until
  // experience-pricing-check's loop-stability arm existed. BOTH HALVES WERE
  // STALE: the arm is arm 3 of that gate, it was built, and it passes; the flag
  // was turned on. The prose simply never followed. gates.ts's tier comment said
  // the same thing and is corrected with it.
  //
  // ⚠ ARM 3 MEASURES LOOP GAIN, NOT DRIFT, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS WORTH KNOWING
  // BEFORE READING ITS PASS AS A GENERAL ONE. It is a perturbation experiment —
  // twin games, one shocked — asserting A x B < 1, and it declines the ambient
  // measurement on purpose: "watching an already-stable system settle proves
  // nothing". Twin-differencing cancels anything common to both twins, so an
  // exogenous ramp in the pricing basis would be invisible to it by
  // construction, and loop gain below 1 does not by itself exclude one.
  //
  // THERE IS NO SUCH RAMP. experience-pricing-drift-check measures it directly —
  // Property is the clean instrument, its held path being a constant with no
  // trend and no wage divisor — and reads -0.03% +/- 1.96% over 24 games on a
  // roster that moves 0.000%. It is GREEN and it is a guard, not an open item.
  //
  // ⚠ THE OBVIOUS STORY FOR A RAMP WAS MEASURED AND IS FALSE, recorded here so
  // nobody re-derives it: that this path prices off the pool's own BOOKED
  // triangle, FORWARD_BOOKING contracts every occurrence before the triangle
  // sees it, and so each year another under-booked cohort ramps the rate down.
  // Steepening Property's contraction moves the charged rate's LEVEL hard — k
  // 0.9245 -> 0.80 more than halves it — and moves its TREND not at all, which

  // lambda-indexed (GL) Monte Carlo grids, which were derived from a MODEL of
  // the draw rather than the draw: measured against the engine, WC's grid
  // over-delivered at every one of nine stops. A static table backtested on the
  // engine cannot carry that class of error.
  //
  // Two consequences of the table being one curve per line: it takes NO book
  // argument, and it is calibrated at the DEFAULT layer placement (declining
  // layers costs up to ~8.9pp of label accuracy — measured, and recorded at
  // clfTables.ts).
  //
  // ⚠ THE NO-BOOK-ARGUMENT DECISION NO LONGER RESTS ON WHAT IT USED TO. This
  // said the size axis bought little "because the book holds near 62 members
  // since the membership equilibrium fix". There is no equilibrium any more —
  // the target came out and the book is an outcome, running roughly 76 -> 92
  // enrolled at defaults and reaching 64 at the strict appetite bar. The
  // decision to keep one curve SURVIVED that, but for a different reason: a
  // size axis makes the rate move as the book moves, which is a second feedback
  // between membership and pricing, and the measured cost of not having one is
  // small. The tables are now derived at the middle of the trajectory rather
  // than at a static book. clfTables.ts carries the per-band numbers.
  //
  // ⚠ PROPERTY READS ITS OWN DERIVED TABLE. The paragraph that stood here said
  // it "STILL READS THE GENERIC FUNDING_CLF_TABLE" and had "no derived table to
  // dispatch to yet", and it was flatly contradicted by the hasStaticClf note
  // twenty lines below in this same comment. PROPERTY_DERIVED landed and
  // hasStaticClf has covered all three lines since. The generic table's error on
  // Property — its 60% stop delivered 54.3%, the range running -18.7pp to

  // not touch it. Net effect: one full pass over the book, computing two
  // expected-loss sums, removed from the pricing path each line-year.

  //
  // Risk control is deliberately ABSENT here while multiplying the draws'
  // frequency (finding 17): applying it to both sides would cancel and rebuild
  // the no-op. Instance lossTrend is likewise absent from the claim lines —
  // GL's 7% social inflation acts on the accident-to-settlement lag, which is
  // year-invariant, so its expectation (and held premium) is constant.
  // lossTrend remains Property-only.
  //
  // ⚠ WC'S FREQUENCY TREND IS NOW PRICED, AND IT DID NOT USE TO BE. The draw has
  // always trended frequency at -1.5%/yr with year 1 as the reference; the price
  // was a single held constant that never saw the year. So realized loss ran below
  // the priced level BY CONSTRUCTION and the gap compounded — 93.5% of expected
  // averaged over ten years, which turned an expected 100.0% combined ratio into a
  // measured 93.9% and accounted for essentially all of the pool's underwriting
  // drift. It was documented as deliberate and inherited from the retired model;
  // it is overturned here.
  //
  // THIS DOES NOT BREAK THE HELD-PURE-PREMIUM RULE. The rule exists because
  // RE-DERIVING the pick each year double-corrects against k_line, which already
  // makes the roster/risk-quality-mix correction, and creates a pricing-chases-
  // roster feedback loop. wcFrequencyTrend is a pure function of yearNumber and
  // one constant — it cannot see the roster — so the derivation stays held and
  // only a deterministic factor is applied on top. Note the WC branch reads the
  // HELD CONSTANT, never lineState.purePremiumPer100, so the factor is applied
  // fresh each year rather than compounding off last year's stored value; only
  // Property's branch compounds, and deliberately.
  // WC'S RATE CARRIES THREE DETERMINISTIC FACTORS, and all three must be here or
  // the draw and the price diverge — the defect finding 37 corrected, and it is
  // reintroduced by adding any one of them without the others.
  //
  //   x wcFrequencyTrend    -1.5%/yr   claims per worker fall
  //   x wcSeverityTrend     +3.67%/yr  each claim costs more
  //   / wageFactor          +3.63%/yr  the rate is per $100 of NOMINAL payroll,
  //                                    and the denominator has grown
  //
  //   net: 0.985 x 1.0367 / 1.0363 = 0.98538  ->  -1.462%/yr
  //
  // The severity and wage factors nearly cancel BY CONSTRUCTION (indemnity
  // benefits are a statutory fraction of wage), which is why the rate trend is
  // very close to the frequency trend alone. Dividing by wageFactor is what makes
  // premium growth come out at freqTrend x sevTrend = +2.115%/yr INDEPENDENT of
  // the wage rate — a useful check: if premium growth moves when only
  // WAGE_INFLATION_PER_YEAR changes, one of these three is missing.
  //
  // Still HELD: WC_HELD_PURE_PREMIUM_PER_100 is derived once from the neutral
  // full-roster expectation. All three factors are pure functions of the year and
  // cannot see the roster, so k_line keeps sole responsibility for the
  // roster/risk-quality-mix correction.

  // own tables here too, for the same reason as selectedFundingCLF above.
  //
  // ⚠ THIS SITE BECAME BASIS-CONSISTENT FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH THE STATIC
  // TABLES, and the effect is large enough to name. expectedNetUnpaidLoss is a
  // NET reserve, and the retired grids' 90% CLF was a percentile of the GROSS
  // annual loss distribution — a net quantity multiplied by a gross-basis
  // loading. The static tables are measured on RETAINED loss, so both sides of
  // this product are now net. GL's 90% CLF falls from ~1.79 to 1.3642 and WC's
  // from ~1.54 to 1.3893 as a result.
  //
  // ⚠ IT NO LONGER MOVES OPENING SURPLUS — and that is a deliberate repair, not
  // an accident of the current numbers. This margin USED to be the pre-game's
  // acceptance basis: runPriorHistory accepted an opening only inside
  // OPENING_MULTIPLE_BAND x THIS quantity, so every change to the reserve, to
  // the reserve-margin CLF, or to the funding basis re-rated every game's
  // starting surplus. It did, three commits running (f328d65, fab85e4, 962ef60);
  // the worst of it moved GL's median opening from $21.29M to $11.72M and needed
  // a MEDIAN OF 28 REDRAWS to land in band. The pre-game now tests against
  // PREMIUM, so this margin had no consumer on the opening path at all.
  //
  // ⚠ THAT IS NOW HALF TRUE AND THE CHANGE WAS ARGUED FOR, NOT SLIPPED IN. WC
  // and GL are graded against the opening NET RESERVE (OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND),
  // which is exactly the "condition the opening on reserve risk" this paragraph
  // said to argue for explicitly. What it warned against — the 90% CLF becoming
  // a LIVE consumer of the opening path — did not happen: the multiple is
  // FROZEN_CAPITAL_J, a literal frozen at calibration, so moving the CLF table
  // moves nothing here. The RESERVE moves the opening, the CLF does not.
  // Property is still on premium. KEEP THE FREEZE: replacing those literals with
  // a call to the CLF table is the coupling, not the reserve basis.
  //
  // ⚠ THE ONE THING THAT MAY LEGITIMATELY READ THIS RATIO IS A ONE-OFF
  // CALIBRATION. Because reserveMarginCLF is a static per-line table, the line
  // below makes margin/reserve an EXACT constant — staticClf(line,
  // RESERVE_MARGIN_CONFIDENCE) - 1 on each line, zero dispersion across seeds and
  // across both payout-pattern arms. (The three figures that stood here were read
  // off tables that have since moved; the expression is what stays true.) So any "hold J x reserve" capital rule is "hold T x this margin"
  // wearing a different denominator, and adopting one puts the 90% CLF back on
  // the opening path. The consequences are worked through beside
  // OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND in defaultAssumptions.ts, together with the
  // reserve pin that was measured and rejected. Read that before wiring anything

  //
  // ⚠ AND A DENOMINATOR IS ONLY HALF OF A BASIS. Both denominators now contain
  // the NET-funded poolPremium, so a GROSS numerator over either of them is

  //
  // ⚠ THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO GENERIC `sum` HELPER ANY MORE. There was one, and
  // every field went through it, and SEVEN pool-scope defects reached players
  // that way. THREE of them landed directly beside a comment warning about this
  // exact class, which is the evidence that a comment cannot fix it: a warning
  // naming three fields did not stop the fourth being added underneath it.
  //
  // Adding across lines is only valid for some KINDS of quantity. Pick the
  // helper that says which kind you have. The name is the argument — a call site
  // reading `addDollars('netIncome')` states its own justification, and
  // `noPoolMeaning` forces you to write down why there isn't one.
  //
  //   addDollars              extensive money. Two lines' dollars are the same
  //                           unit and genuinely add. The large majority.
  //   addEnrolments           per-line enrolment counts. A member with two lines
  //                           counts twice. LEGITIMATE AS A WEIGHT, never as a
  //                           headcount — see distinctMembers below for that.
  //   addMixedUnitExposure    WC/GL payroll ($M) plus Property TIV ($M). Adding
  //                           them is a category error; the result is retained
  //                           only because display code still reads it, and it
  //                           must never be labelled with a unit at pool scope.
  //   (noPoolMeaning          RETIRED. It returned a placeholder and recorded why
  //                           in a string the compiler discarded, so the field
  //                           still had a readable number and pages still read

      // is a real reason to pay slower.

      // ⚠ DO NOT REPLACE IT WITH A FLOOR ON THE ULTIMATE AT PAID. That is
      // physically correct — a case reserve cannot go negative — but at late
      // ages cumulativePaid approaches 1, so any downward draw binds and the

      // It still TERMINATES cohorts — 209 GL and 161 Property closes in that

// Only the JOINT law moves. That is a strictly weaker change than widening any

// rejected. See IBNER_CALENDAR_RHO for the measurements behind that ruling.
//
// ⚠ rng.normal IS CONSUMED UNCONDITIONALLY, AND THAT IS THE NULL TEST'S
// REQUIREMENT, NOT A STYLE CHOICE. Skipping the draw at rho = 0 would leave the

// "null" arm would differ from the shipped path for a reason having nothing to
// do with this mechanism. Same discipline as PER_CLAIM_REVISION's own note at
// the allocation branch.
//
// ⚠ AND AT rho = 0 THIS RETURNS THE SHIPPED DRAW ITSELF, NOT AN ARITHMETICALLY
// EQUAL REARRANGEMENT OF IT. The early return hands back `rng.normal(0, 1)`
// with no operation applied, so `Math.exp(sigma * z - (sigma * sigma) / 2)` at

// expm1(weight x -ln(1 - bias)) whose product over the horizon was exactly
// 1/(1 - bias). That exactness was a property of multiplying the whole ULTIMATE.
