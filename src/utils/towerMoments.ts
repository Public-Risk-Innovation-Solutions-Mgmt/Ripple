// PER-OCCURRENCE CEDED/RETAINED MOMENTS FOR THE REINSURANCE TOWER — the closed
// form that replaced six frozen constants.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS: sdOverExpected WAS NEVER A RATE-CARD QUANTITY.
//
// The tower used to price off two stored per-layer constants,
// `expectedCededPer100` and `sdOverExpected`. The first freezes legitimately —
// a per-occurrence layer's expected ceded loss is LINEAR in exposure, because
// only occurrence FREQUENCY scales with the book while E[ceded per occurrence]
// is exposure-invariant. The second does NOT:
//
//   SD/E scales as ~1/sqrt(exposure), so ITS BASIS IS ITS VALUE.
//
// Measured on GL's $4M xs $1M band, analytically:
//   $87M book (10 members)     SD/E 1.581
//   $380M book (55 members)    SD/E 0.776     <- where the stored 0.97 sat
//   $1300M book (200, full)    SD/E 0.452
//   $26,000M book (4,000)      SD/E 0.220
//
// Frozen at one book's value, the risk load is wrong everywhere else — and
// wrong in the WORST direction. Holding GL's 4xs1 SD/E at the stored 0.97:
//   $82M pool     true 1.976x    frozen 1.582x    -19.9%  UNDERCHARGED
//   $1300M pool   true 1.271x    frozen 1.582x    +24.5%  overcharged
// The pools with the least surplus behind the retention were paying the least
// for it. That is a larger error than the trend drift this commit also fixes,
// and unlike the drift it does not need ten years to appear.
//
// The two lines were additionally on DIFFERENT bases for the same field: GL's
// stored SD/E was measured on a ~$380M enrolled book, WC's full-market.
// ============================================================================
//
// WHAT IS COMPUTED HERE, AND ON WHAT BASIS.
//
// NEUTRAL RISK QUALITY (RQ 5), deliberately, and this is a DELIBERATE
// NON-CHANGE. The retired constants were a neutral-RQ rate card
// (reinsuranceTower.ts's derivation note, and the retired wc-tower-rederive's "a per-$100
// rate card should not carry one book's risk-quality mix"). Keeping that basis
// means the ONLY things this commit changes about the price are the two that
// were actually broken — responsiveness to the YEAR and to the BOOK'S SIZE.
// Moving to actual RQ would additionally put the severity TILT into a price,
// which invariant 2 forbids (tilt is draw-and-k_line only, never pricing), and
// would confound three changes where the plan approved two.
//
// THE BOOK'S RATING-GROUP MIX *is* now reflected, for WC, because the
// computation walks the actual enrolled members. (It reflected the REGION mix
// too until region left chronic severity; there is no regional dimension to
// reflect any more.) wc-tower-rederive recorded
// that the frozen constant "does not correct for a book that is unusually
// safety-heavy" as a known limitation; walking the book removes it for free.
// GL has no such dimension — its rate and mixture are flat across member types
// — so GL's expected ceded PER $100 is exactly roster-blind, a pure function of
// the year.
//
// ⚠ THE MEMO KEY IS THE DANGEROUS PART OF THIS MODULE. A wrong key silently
// prices one year's tower with another year's moments, and every downstream
// figure stays self-consistent, so no value gate would catch it. The key must
// capture EXACTLY what the cached value depends on, no more and no less:
//
//   band moments depend on: line, layer bounds, SEVERITY-trended year,
//                           and (WC only) rating group
//   they do NOT depend on:  the book, exposure, frequency trend, RQ
//
// The frequency trend is applied OUTSIDE the cache, in the accumulation, which
// is why it is absent from the key. And the year is FLOORED before keying,
// because wcSeverityTrend/glSeverityTrend both floor at year 1 — so year -2 and
// year 1 are genuinely the same moments and must share a slot rather than
// occupying two that could drift apart.
//
// scripts/diagnostics/tower-runtime-check.ts asserts all of this on every run:
// cold-cache and warm-cache interleaved evaluation must agree exactly, distinct
// years must produce distinct values, and year 1 full-market must reproduce the
// closed-form reference literals.
