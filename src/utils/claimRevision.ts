// ============================================================================
// THE PER-CLAIM REVISION LAW — MECHANISM. STAGE 1, FLAG-GATED AND OFF.
//
// ⚠ THE FLAG IS OFF AND THE COHORT PATH IS UNTOUCHED. PER_CLAIM_REVISION.enabled
// is false, so processIbner never reaches reviseDevelopingSet below and the
// engine develops cohorts exactly as it did before Stage 1 — bit-identically, on
// both standing gates. This module IS now wired: simulationEngine imports
// reviseDevelopingSet, behind that one flag. The fitted parameters and the
// reasoning behind each component live at CLAIM_REVISION_* in
// defaultAssumptions.ts; this file is only how they are applied.
//
// ============================================================================
// DERIVED, NEVER STORED — AND THAT IS NOW AFFORDABLE.
//
// A claim's whole revision path is a pure function of (gameId, claimId, age).
// Nothing about it is persisted, exactly as claimClosureUnit persists nothing:
// Ruling 8 keeps the claim register out of the save, and claimRegeneration.ts
// (dbcfed7) makes the register reachable again on demand, so a consumer that
// needs a claim's carried value at some age can redraw the register and walk
// this law forward. Before regeneration existed that was not true and Stage 1
// was blocked on it.
//
// The hash is claimClosureUnit's, with the age and a purpose label folded in.
// It is deliberately NOT the project's SeededRandom, for claimClosureUnit's
// reason: consuming from a seeded stream would move every downstream draw and
// re-roll the game, for a quantity that is a read-time property of a claim that
// already exists.
//
// ⚠ THE PURPOSE LABELS MUST STAY DISTINCT, and the frequency/sign/magnitude
// draws at one age must not share a unit. They did in a first cut, and the
// symptom was invisible from the totals: a claim that moved always moved in the
// same direction, because the same uniform decided both.

 * e = 1 and 2950% at e = 0.
 *
 * ⚠ BUT s IS NOT BOUNDED, AND THE TAIL BEING SHUT IS NOT THE SAME CLAIM. h^-0.5
 * still diverges as a cohort pays down, and the engine feeds it the cohort's
 * REALISED balance, which goes far lower than any payout pattern. What removed
 * the tail is not a smaller s — it is that the CANCELLATION is gone. At e = 0
 * the delta's h cancelled the factor's 1/h exactly, so an enormous s on a
 * nearly-exhausted cohort still moved full dollars. At e = 0.5 the delta goes as
 * sqrt(h): s runs away precisely where the balance it multiplies is vanishing,
 * and the product does not. Anyone tempted to clamp s should read that twice —
 * the magnitude was never the mechanism.
 *
 * ⚠ EXTRACTED FROM reviseOnce SO THERE IS STILL ONE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW.
 * The engine has to scale the factor onto the COHORT's own remaining balance
 * rather than onto the claim's pattern-implied reserve — see

//
// 1. THE UNTRACKED MASS KEEPS THE COHORT FACTOR. It is a single scalar standing
//    for ~490 sub-retention occurrences, and the law needs a per-claim value it
//    does not have. Giving the blob one claim's revision would overstate its
//    movement by the diversification it actually has (490 independent draws
//    average out; one does not), and giving it none would understate the
//    cohort's total movement badly, since most of the COUNT lives there. So it
//    keeps exactly what it gets today — `untracked * (factor - 1)` from the
//    cohort lognormal, passed in — and the law reaches the tracked set, which
//    is every occurrence that can ever cede. Named here rather than discovered
//    at the flip.
//
// 2. SEED COHORTS ARE UNCHANGED. A cohort with no register has nothing to
//    revise; processIbner's no-register branch keeps the cohort factor whether
//    the flag is on or off. That is the same honest default as today, where a
//    seed cohort retains its development entire.

 *     sum(d) >= -B . sum(w) = -B      so      B + sum(d) >= 0
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE BOUND SURVIVES CESSION, which is where it has to hold. cedeDevelopment
 * returns the pool's retained share, retained_i = P(v_i + d_i) - P(v_i) for the
 * pool's retained function P, which is non-decreasing with P(0) = 0 and is
 * 1-Lipschitz (the ceded derivative is never negative). So retained_i >= d_i
 * wherever d_i < 0, and retained_i >= 0 wherever d_i >= 0. Hence
 * sum(retained) >= -B and the NET balance cannot cross zero either. Nothing
 * above requires any relationship between the register and netUltimate — which
 * is exactly why the alternative, h = netUnpaid / netUltimate, does NOT close:
 * measured, the register exceeds netUltimate on 89% of cohort-valuations
 * (median 1.31x, p95 2.86x) because the register is GROSS and netUltimate is NET.
 *
 * ⚠ THE SAME h GOES INTO THE FACTOR AND INTO THE DELTA, AND IT MUST BE THE SAME
 * ONE. revisionFactor raises it to e-1 = -0.50 and the delta multiplies by h
 * again, so to first order
 *     d_i ~ v_i . h . s . Z = v_i . phi . m . sqrt(h) . Z
 * — half the h cancels and half survives. That surviving half IS the ruling (see
 * CLAIM_REVISION_HEADROOM_EXPONENT); it is not a residual to tidy away. Passing
 * the PATTERN's headroom to the factor and the COHORT's to the delta would mix
 * two different h's into one product and silently rescale every movement, which
 * is a live hazard rather than a hypothetical: that mismatch is exactly what
 * caused the ledger crossing this function's bound now closes.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT COSTS, STATED: h is smaller than the pattern headroom on an
 * exhausted cohort, so s is larger there — by 1/sqrt(h) rather than the 1/h that
 * made s reach 22.75 by GL age 8, but larger. This fix makes the reserve arithmetic
 * exact and makes that tail worse. It is a recorded open item, not a surprise,
 * and it is bounded in practice: the engine's worst cohort at this exponent is
 * 63-88% of register.
 *
 * `cohort.untrackedFactor` is the cohort lognormal, applied to the mass that has
 * no claim ids to revise. It is inside the same h and the same weights, so it is
 * inside the bound — under the previous form it was `U . (factor - 1)`, with no
 * headroom scaling at all, and was one of the two ways the balance was overdrawn.
 *
 * ⚠ THE COHORT ARGUMENTS ARE AN OBJECT AND THAT IS NOT STYLE. This function took
 * four bare numbers for one commit, and adding them silently broke
 * revision-persistence-check: every parameter is a `number`, so a caller left on
 * the old order compiled, ran, and reported 0% upward movements against 50%. It
 * was caught in FAST the same run, which is the system working — but a signature

   * bounded by the balance to close the ledger crossing. Copying the generator

   * the ultimate and the unpaid together, so `netUnpaid >= 0` is not the binding
   * constraint. Only downward movement needs the balance bound, and the
   * stochastic term keeps it.

 * "CLOSES AT ZERO" LITERALLY TRUE. A claim settling at factor 0 lands at
 * v.(1 - h) = v.paidShare — its paid to date — rather than at nothing. The
 * previous form was `v.(f - 1)`, i.e. h implicitly 1, which removed a claim's
 * whole carried value from a balance that had only ever held h of it. That was
 * the second of the two overdrafts and it doubled the crossing rate.
 *
 *     d_i = v_i . h . (f_i - 1) >= -v_i . h   for the settling set only,
 *     sum(d) >= -h . sum(v over settling) >= -h . R = -B
 *
 * ⚠ IT RE-OPENS CLAIM_SETTLEMENT_FACTOR.nonZeroScale. That level was solved so
 * E[f] cancels the persistence drift on a WHOLE-VALUE basis. On the reserve basis
 * the expected effect on a claim's value is 1 + h.(E[f] - 1), so the offset is
 * scaled by h and is weaker — and h varies by cohort, so no single scalar
 * cancels the drift exactly any more. See the measurement recorded at
 * CLAIM_SETTLEMENT_FACTOR.
