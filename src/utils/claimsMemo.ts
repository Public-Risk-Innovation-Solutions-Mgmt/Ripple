// ============================================================================
// THE CLAIMS DEPARTMENT — the large-loss listing.
//
// A register of individual claims as at a valuation date: who, what status,
// what has been paid, what it is incurred at. It replaced a development
// schedule (as first written / now / development), and that is a change of
// SUBJECT rather than of presentation — development is the actuarial memo's
// question, and that memo keeps the count and a pointer to here.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ IT READS THE CLAIM REGISTER, NOT THE TRACKED DEVELOPING SET, AND THE
// DIFFERENCE DECIDES EVERYTHING BELOW.
//
// The exhibit this replaces read `reserveCohorts[].developingClaims` — the 3-10
// occurrences per cohort that development is allocated across. That set can
// answer "what moved". It cannot answer "what has been paid", and the reason is
// not that the field is missing but that the QUESTION is about the whole
// accident year: paid is allocated across every claim in the year, so a split
// computed over ten of them would hand each claim roughly fifty times its
// share. A second allocation would also be a second IMPLEMENTATION, and the
// claims workbook already has one — so the same claim would carry two different
// Gross Paid figures in two documents.
//
// So this reads the register, through the same two functions the workbook uses:
// `claimPaidSplit` for the paid allocation and `isClaimClosed` for status. One
// implementation, and the two documents cannot disagree.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THAT COSTS: THE MATURATION YEARS DROP OUT. The seven years simulated
// to build the opening book are never carried into priorHistory, so they have
// no ResultSet and no register — the register spans accident years -2..N, the
// cohorts span -9..N. Those years contributed 211 of 839 rows to the old
// development ranking. They cannot contribute here, because the columns this
// exhibit now has do not exist for them at all, and the note at the foot says
// so rather than letting the absence read as quiet.
//
// ⚠ AND IT COSTS 41 ms, WHICH IS WHY THE DECISION WAS NOT A PERFORMANCE ONE.
// On a reloaded game every year's register has to be redrawn by
// claimRegeneration. Measured over a full year-10 book: 39 line-years, 10,596
// claims, 41 ms — against 1 ms when the claims are still in memory. Estimated
// beforehand at several seconds, which would have changed the answer; it was
// measured instead.
//
// ============================================================================
// THREE SECTIONS AGAIN, AND BOTH PREMISES BEHIND THE ONE-TABLE DECISION MOVED.
//
// The single table was right for the exhibit as it then was, and it rested on
// two things that the open filter changed underneath it:
//
//   the dominance was gone       a single ranking by INCURRED ran WC 4 / GL 8 /
//                                PR 8 in one game and WC 4 / GL 6 / PR 10 in
//                                another, so no line crowded the others out.
//   Program earned its column    with one table, the line had to be on the row.
//
// Filtering to open files changes the first — open inventories differ sharply by
// line, so one ranking would be a WC ranking — and sections carrying the line
// name make the second redundant by construction. So: three sections, ten rows
// each, ranked by current incurred within each.
//
// ============================================================================
// OPEN FILES ONLY, AND THE TENTH ROW IS SMALL ON TWO OF THE THREE LINES.
//
// Settled files cannot move again, so an inventory of them is a history. The
// filter is severe: measured at year 10, open files are a small minority of each
// register, and what the tenth row reaches down to is worth stating plainly.
//
//   as at year 10       register   open        #1        #5       #10
//     WC   game 0          5,720    766 (13%)  $6.54M   $1.84M   $1.15M
//     WC   game 1          6,270    901 (14%)  $3.44M   $1.48M   $1.05M
//     GL   game 0          4,268    661 (15%)  $1.75M   $0.67M   $0.37M
//     GL   game 1          4,596    572 (12%)  $5.93M   $2.03M   $1.49M
//     PR   game 0            608     36  (6%)  $6.23M   $0.57M   $0.24M
//     PR   game 1            507     44  (9%)  $3.32M   $1.64M   $0.61M
//
// ⚠ SO THERE IS NO MATERIALITY FLOOR, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN AN
// OMISSION. GL's and Property's tenth rows are small — $0.37M and $0.24M in one
// game — and a listing padded to ten with immaterial rows is worse than a short
// one. Every floor considered was either invented or borrowed:
//
//   a fixed dollar threshold   arbitrary, and wrong across lines whose top open
//                              file ranges from $1.75M to $6.54M in one game.
//   a share of the section's   cuts Property to four rows and leaves GL's ten
//   largest                    untouched, because GL's open book is flat.
//   the first-layer retention  $1M / $1M / $5M. DERIVED, and it gives sections
//                              of 10 / 2 / 1 — because it is calibrated for what
//                              a reinsurer attaches on, not for what a claims
//                              reader watches. Borrowing it here is the
//                              well-derived-but-wrong-question trap.
//
// What a small tenth row actually says is that the line's open inventory IS
// small, which is true and worth seeing. So each section prints its own count
// and range — "10 of 661 open GL files, $1.75M down to $0.37M" — and a reader
// judges materiality with the numbers in front of them.
//
// ⚠ AND A SHORT OR EMPTY SECTION SAYS SO. Every line had at least 36 open files
// in every game and valuation measured, so neither case arises at defaults — but
// both are reachable on an early valuation or a line the pool has barely
// written, and a three-row Property section that does not explain itself reads
// as a bug. A short section names the count; an empty one says the register has
// wholly settled and points at the workbook.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ INCURRED HERE IS NOT THE WORKBOOK'S Gross Incurred, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS
// DELIBERATE. Both documents say so.
//
//   this listing        the claim's share of its cohort's CURRENT gross
//                       ultimate — one figure per claim, on the same vintage as
//                       the Paid beside it.
//   claims workbook     Gross Incurred is the claim AS DRAWN and never
//                       develops, and the workbook carries the developed
//                       figures separately in its Drawn / Booked / Current
//                       Occurrence block.
//
// A workbook is a data export and can carry both vintages in adjacent columns;
// a one-line-per-claim listing can carry one, and for a large-loss listing it
// has to be the one the Paid column is on. The workbook's own note already
// warned that its two columns are not the same vintage and that their ratio is
// not a paid-to-incurred; that warning is now narrower, because the document it
// pointed a reader towards is this one.
//
// ⚠ SO Paid / Incurred IS A REAL RATIO HERE AND IS NOT ONE IN THE WORKBOOK.
// That is the whole reason for the difference and it is worth stating plainly,
// because two documents disagreeing about one claim is exactly what this file
// went out of its way to avoid on the Paid column.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE DESCRIPTION COLUMN RENDERS ONLY WHEN SOMETHING POPULATES IT.
//
// `Claim.description` exists and nothing writes one. An always-empty column
// reads as a defect to anyone looking at it — a reader cannot tell a column
// waiting for content from a column whose content failed to load. So the field
// is built, the reader is here, and the column appears the day a claim has one.
//
// The alternative considered was rendering it empty so the shape is visible.
// Rejected: the shape is visible in this file and in the type, which is where
// someone who needs to know looks; a player only sees a blank column.

 * net dollars in a column headed Paid on exactly the old accident years nobody
 * re-checks. Rewinding the money is not available at any price this change
 * could pay.
