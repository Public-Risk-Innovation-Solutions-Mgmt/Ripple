// GL's OWN loss-distribution shape, replacing the shared FUNDING_CLF_TABLE for
// GL pricing — the same mismatch WC's grid fixed (wcLossDistribution.ts,
// wcClfGrid.ts). FUNDING_CLF_TABLE is the real pool's curve at $20-30B of
// payroll, where process risk gives an annual loss-ratio CV near 0.063 against
// the table's implied ~0.80 — parameter/trend uncertainty this model has no
// channel for, not claim variance. GL's own process CV runs 0.83-4.3 across the
// enrollable range (see glClfGrid.ts), so the SAME table mismatches GL's curve
// in the OPPOSITE direction from WC's: WC's grid narrowed the table, GL's
// widens it. PROCESS RISK ONLY here — do not "correct" this module toward
// FUNDING_CLF_TABLE's numbers; see wcClfGrid.ts's header for the full argument,
// unchanged by which line it's applied to.
//
// TWO PARTS, mirroring wcLossDistribution.ts:
//   1. glAggregateCumulants — the analytic mean, variance and expected CLAIM
//      COUNT (lambda) of the aggregate annual gross loss, for a given enrolled
//      book. lambda, NOT CV, is what the grid interpolation is indexed on (see
//      glClfGrid.ts for why CV was rejected for GL specifically, unlike WC).
//   2. computeGlClf — the percentile lookup, interpolating a Monte Carlo
//      percentile GRID (src/data/glClfGrid.ts) on lambda.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE CUMULANT DERIVATION, for the record — and it is NOT a copy of WC's.
//
// GL has a THIRD source of variance WC's module has no equivalent for: gPool,
// the pool-wide loss factor every GL draw consumes (WC's own commonLossFactor
// is pinned to 1 at the severity rebuild, so WC's cumulants have no analogous
// term — see simulationEngine.ts's commonLossFactor comment). gPool is drawn
// ONCE per year and multiplies EVERY member's rate SIMULTANEOUSLY, so it does
// NOT diversify away with book size the way independent per-member frequency
// noise does — it is a SHARED risk factor, not an idiosyncratic one, and it
// requires a genuinely different piece of cumulant algebra: a law-of-total-
// variance mixture over a common factor, not a per-member sum.
//
// Per member i (payroll > 0), define the deterministic rate
//   lambda_i = payroll_i x ratePer1M x memberThetaGl(rq_i) x kGl
// (excludes risk control, per invariant 2, and excludes gPool/frequency-noise —
// those are the two random multipliers being mixed out below) and, at the
// member's own TILTED (draw-matching) weights and this year's dollars, the
// CAPPED severity raw moments m1_i = E[min(X,cap)], m2_i = E[min(X,cap)^2].
//
// CONDITIONAL ON g (one realization of gPool), member i's own frequency noise
// epsilon_i ~ Gamma(shape=8, mean=1) is INDEPENDENT across members (separate
// RNG stream per member.id), so conditional on g the members are independent
// and each one's own cumulants follow the ORDINARY compound-Poisson-Gamma
// result (WC's derivation, restated per member, with the rate scaled by g):
//   kappa_1,i(g) = lambda_i x g x m1_i
//   kappa_2,i(g) = lambda_i x g x m2_i + (lambda_i x g x m1_i)^2 / alpha_freq
// Summing over independent members (still conditional on g):
//   E[S|g]   = g x A1,             A1 = sum_i lambda_i x m1_i
//   Var(S|g) = g x A2 + g^2 x B2,  A2 = sum_i lambda_i x m2_i
//                                  B2 = sum_i (lambda_i x m1_i)^2 / alpha_freq
//
// NOW MIX OVER g ~ Gamma(shape=25, mean=1) (WC_LOSS_MODEL.poolYearFactor — the
// SAME shared draw GL's generator consumes and WC's does not), via the law of
// total variance, E[g]=1, E[g^2]=Var(g)+1=1+Vg, Vg=1/25=0.04:
//   E[S]   = E_g[g x A1] = A1
//   Var(S) = E_g[Var(S|g)] + Var_g[E(S|g)]
//          = A2 x E[g] + B2 x E[g^2] + A1^2 x Var(g)
//          = A2 + B2 x (1 + Vg) + A1^2 x Vg
//
// The (1+Vg) weight on B2 and the A1^2 x Vg term are exactly what a per-member
// derivation (correct for WC, wrong for GL) would MISS — gPool correlates every
// member's outcome, so its contribution to variance does not average down as
// the book grows, unlike ordinary idiosyncratic frequency noise.
//
// VERIFIED against Monte Carlo at the full roster with an honest CI — see
// gl-clf-grid-derive.ts's dedicated section. This was NOT POSSIBLE before the
// severity cap: uncapped, half of E[X^2] came from above $1.42B, once per 5,182
// years, so no feasible sample could touch the region the analytic most needed
// checking. Capped, half comes from above $58.0M, once per ~15 full-market
// years — thousands of such claims in a half-million-draw run.
