// ============================================================================
// THE COHORT READERS THREE DOCUMENTS SHARE — gross paid, gross ultimate, and
// per-occurrence development, read off `poolState.lines[].reserveCohorts`.
//
// ⚠ EACH OF THESE WAS WRITTEN THREE TIMES AND THE COPIES HAD DRIFTED. The
// claims workbook, the claims memo and the actuarial memo each walked the
// cohorts themselves. Nothing about that was gratuitous — each walk is six
// lines — but three walks are three places for a rule to change in one and not
// the others, and one had: the actuarial memo's developed-occurrence count
// carried a $1,000 floor the workbook's listing did not, so the same book was
// 778 occurrences in one document and 840 in the other.
//
// ⚠ AND THE FIX IS NOT TO PICK ONE FLOOR — see countDevelopedOccurrences. The
// two documents ask different questions and both answers were right. What was
// wrong is that the difference lived in a magic number nobody could see from
// either call site. It is a named parameter here, with the measurement.
//
// ⚠ EVERY READER HERE IS AT THE CURRENT VALUATION, because reserveCohorts IS
// the current valuation — it is live state, not a history. A cohort carries
// `grossPaid` and `grossUnpaid` AS THEY STAND NOW and no earlier pair. The only
// per-valuation history in the model is `reserveDevelopment.paidByValuation`,
// which is NET, so a document on a GROSS basis cannot rewind at all. That is
// not a gap to be filled later; it is the reason buildClaimsMemo strikes at the
// latest valuation rather than at a year a reader picks. The one quantity that
// CAN be rewound is development, because movementByStep keeps the per-step
// series — which is what asAtYear means in countDevelopedOccurrences and
// nowhere else in this file.

 * Measured on a seven-year game: 508 claims read OPEN at the workbook's

 * ⚠ A PRE-GAME-ONLY STATE STRIKES AT ITS LAST PRE-GAME YEAR RATHER THAN AT 0.
 * Before year 1 is played there are no locked results, and defaulting to 0
 * would resolve every pre-game claim's closure at a curve age of
 * `0 - accidentYear + 1` — right by luck for the last pre-game year and wrong
 * for the others. This is the rule claimsExport already used; it is here so the
 * workbook and the memo cannot answer it differently.

 *                  true row of that listing, and a data export that silently
 *                  dropped rows would be the worse defect. No floor, by design.
 *   this count     backs a SENTENCE — "N occurrences have had development land
 *                  on them". Counting an occurrence that moved by $0 makes that
 *                  sentence false, so a floor is not a nicety here.
 *
 * ⚠ THE VALUE $1,000 IS ARBITRARY AND THE MEASUREMENT SAYS SO. Of 840 tracked
 * occurrences on a seven-year book: 31 moved by exactly nothing, 31 more moved
 * by less than $1,000 (the smallest non-zero movements are $14.39, $19.75,
 * $49.34), and 778 moved by more. So the floor decides 3.7% of the book and the
 * part of it that is load-bearing — excluding the true non-movers — is the
 * `> 0` half. $1,000 is kept because a sentence about claims deteriorating
 * should not count a $14 revaluation, not because the threshold was derived.
 *
 * ⚠ asAtYear IS HONOURED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE IN THIS FILE, because
 * development is the one cohort quantity that keeps a per-step series.
 * `movementByStep` is summed over the steps that had landed BY that valuation.
 * Before this existed the count was always the latest year's, whatever year the
 * reader had selected: measured on a seven-year game it printed 778 at every
 * selection, against true counts of 440 / 493 / 557 / 608 / 664 / 721 / 778 —
 * a 77% overstatement at year 1, converging only at the latest valuation, which
 * is exactly where the gate was testing.
