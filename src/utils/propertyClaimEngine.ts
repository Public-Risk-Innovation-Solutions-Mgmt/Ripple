// PROPERTY claim generator — FITTED to the pool's own nine years of claims.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY THE OLD ONE LOOKED FINE.
//
// The retired design drew ~112 claims a year at a $190,179 mean, from a
// per-LOCATION frequency and a severity of damageRatio x the hit location's
// TIV. The fit says 15.5 claims a year at $435,254: eleven times too many
// claims at 44% of the size. The AAL therefore landed within a factor of three
// BY ACCIDENT, because only the PRODUCT was ever anchored and the two factors
// were free to be wrong in opposite directions.
//
// That is finding 37's defect in a different line: a product can be right
// while both of its factors are wrong, and only fitting them separately finds
// it. The lesson generalises — anchor factors, not products.
//
// WHAT WENT WITH IT:
//   - the per-location frequency basis (frequency is now per $1M of TIV)
//   - damageRatio x locationTiv severity (now a free-standing mixture)
//   - the location schedule, primary-asset chopping and the insured-value cap
//     they produced — severity no longer references a location at all
//   - the separate WEATHER band. Weather is 21% of the non-cat book and IS IN
//     the mixture: baking it in moves the annual CV by 0.02 (0.26 -> 0.24),
//     which does not buy a 345-line event/zone/footprint simulator.
//   - the retired CAT band. ⚠ A NEW ONE IS BACK — see "THE CATASTROPHE BAND"
//     in the generator below and PROPERTY_CAT_MODEL. It is not the retired
//     design: one regional event process with a fixed loss per member hit,
//     priced exactly, rather than per-peril hazard tables and drawn intensities.
//
// ⚠ SEVERITY IS NO LONGER BOUNDED BY INSURED VALUE. The old structure capped
// each claim at its location's TIV by construction. A free-standing mixture has
// no such bound, which is why severityCap exists and why it is not optional —
// see PROPERTY_LOSS_MODEL. Do not reintroduce a location cap on top: the
// mixture was fitted to claim AMOUNTS, which already embody whatever real
// insured-value limits applied.

  // ==========================================================================
  // ⚠ MITIGATION REACHES THIS EVENT, AND IT IS THE FIRST PROGRAM TO REACH ANY
  // SCHEDULED SHOCK. A hardened roof does not leak. A winter storm is ice, snow
  // load and burst pipes on BUILDINGS — no vehicle share at all — so it takes
  // the FULL mitigation rate rather than the attritional band's building-dollar
  // scaling. See propertyMitigation() for why the two differ.
  //
  // ⚠ EVERY TEAM FACES THE SAME STORM; A TEAM THAT MITIGATED FILES FEWER
  // CLAIMS. That is intended, and it is a change in kind for the shock system:
  // a scheduled event used to be a fact about the year, identical for everyone.
  // It still arrives identically — the COUNT DRAW is untouched — and what the
  // pool did about it decides how much of it lands.
  //
  // ⚠ SCALED AFTER THE DRAW, NOT BEFORE, AND THAT IS WHAT KEEPS IT HONEST. The
  // count uniform is consumed first and is unchanged, so the mitigated book
  // keeps a strict PREFIX of the claims the unmitigated book would have had:
  // claim n's member and size are keyed on n, so claims 0..count-1 are the SAME
  // claims. Mitigation removes losses that would have happened; it does not
  // reshuffle the storm into a different one. It also consumes no randomness,
  // so at e = 0 the round() is the identity and the year is bit-identical.
