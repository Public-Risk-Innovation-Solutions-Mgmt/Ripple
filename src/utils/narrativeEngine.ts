  // --- Rate Change --- REMOVED. The Rate Change decision it narrated is gone
  // (CLF-only pricing); a narrative describing the funding-confidence-level
  // decision instead is a pending replacement, not invented here.

  // --- Underwriting --- REMOVED WITH THE SLIDER IT NARRATED. Both branches
  // described the pool in RISK-QUALITY terms ("improved average risk
  // quality"), which is an attribute the player can no longer see per member
  // and which the retired strictness screen selected on directly. A narrative
  // for the experience modifier is a pending replacement, not invented here —
  // the same treatment the Rate Change narrative got above.

  // --- Events ---
  // FIRST, because it is what a player most needs from the year and the first
  // thing they read. One sentence per event, written from what happened —
  // where, which lines, how many claims, how much — by the same template for a
  // scheduled event and a drawn catastrophe (yearEvents.ts), so the two read
  // alike and the cause never shows.
  //
  // ⚠ THIS REPLACES "A shock loss event occurred this year, significantly
  // increasing gross losses", which fired on `shockLossIncurred`: a WC or GL
  // claim over $1M, so nearly every year, and never on a Property catastrophe.
  for (const ev of yearEvents(result)) parts.push(eventSentence(ev));

  // --- Loss Performance ---
  // ⚠ THIS WAS A FOURTH BASIS AND IT CONTRADICTED THE SCREEN IT SAT ON.
  // It read `grossUltimateLoss / totalMemberCharge` — a GROSS numerator over the
  // MEMBER-CHARGE denominator, a combination used nowhere else in the app — and
  // printed the result as "a loss ratio of X". With the headline on the pricing
  // basis, the same year could show 73% in the chip and prose calling it "a
  // favorable loss ratio of 52%". Two numbers, two bases, one screen.
  //
  // ⚠ AND IT WAS NOT INERT, CONTRARY TO A REPORT OF MINE. That report said the
  // prose "sits permanently in the silent middle and never fires", reasoning
  // from the 66.8% POOLED DOLLAR-WEIGHTED average to the per-year firing rate.
  // Those are different statistics. Measured per year over 1,200 pooled
  // observations it fired low on 38.8% and high on 16.7%, silent on 44.6% — so
  // it fired on more than half of all years, on the wrong basis, in prose a
  // player reads. The correction matters because it makes this a live defect
  // rather than dead code.
  //
  // ⚠ THE THRESHOLDS ARE THE HEADER'S, SHARED FROM ONE PLACE, AND THEY ARE
  // ABSOLUTE. They used to be 0.65 and 0.95, anchored on the PRICED expectation —
  // which made the verdict relative to the player's own aggression. A pool
  // funding at 40% and running 0.95 is burning surplus, and calling that
  // favourable because it beat its own price rewards the underpricing. This game
  // exists to show the consequences of aggressive pricing, not to grade a player
  // against it. 1.00 is the line between making and losing money on underwriting;
  // 0.65 and 0.95 marked nothing.
  //
  // ⚠ AND THE VERDICT WORDING HAD TO BECOME ABSOLUTE WITH THE CUTOFF, WHICH THE
  // CUTOFF CHANGE ALONE WOULD HAVE MISSED. The old favourable sentence said
  // "performance was STRONG at X%, against roughly Y% priced". Under the new band
  // that fires below 1.00 against a priced expectation of ~80% at member funding,
  // so it would have printed "strong at 89%, against roughly 80% priced" —
  // praising a year that underperformed its own price. That is the same defect
  // one step along. The sentence states what the ratio DID now; the priced figure
  // stays as context, never as the standard.
  //
  // ⚠ ALL FIVE BANDS SPEAK NOW. Under the four-band scale the 0.90-1.00 band
  // printed NOTHING — a year at 0.97 got no loss sentence at all, which read as
  // an omission rather than a judgement. Every band says what the ratio did.
  //
  // ⚠ AND THE ABSOLUTE DISCIPLINE RUNS THROUGH ALL FIVE, which is the harder
  // half of the five-band change. Every clause below is checkable against the
  // printed number alone: "most of the premium unspent" is what below 0.50
  // MEANS; "lost money this year" is what above 1.00 MEANS. None of them says
  // better, worse, or as expected. ⚠ IN PARTICULAR BAND 1 IS NOT "BETTER THAN
  // PRICED" IN WORDS even though 0.70 is where the price sits — naming the
  // comparison in the sentence is how the relative standard would creep back
  // in, one step along again. The edge is set by the price; the sentence is
  // not. `priced` stays appended to all five as context.
  //
  // MEASURED at 70-85% funding, 24 games x 10 years, 720 line-years (and 240
  // pool-years, which is the scope this actually renders at):
  //   band      <0.50   0.50-0.70   0.70-1.00   1.00-1.10   >=1.10
  //   line      11.9%     43.5%       36.1%        3.6%       4.9%
  //   pool       2.1%     54.2%       40.8%        1.7%       1.3%
  // The top band is rare at both scopes without being dead at either, and the
  // largest band is 43.5% of line-years / 54.2% of pool-years.
  //
  // ⚠ THIS CHANGE SPLIT THE FAVOURABLE MASS AND RE-GRADED NO YEAR AS WORSE.
  // 1.00 and 1.10 did not move, so the two critical bands hold exactly the
  // years they held before — 8.5% of line-years, 3.0% of pool-years, the same
  // ones. Every edge this change introduced is BELOW break-even. That is worth
  // stating because a five-band scale sounds like a harsher one and is not.
  //
  // ⚠ THE EARLIER SWEEP REPORTED THESE A FEW TENTHS APART (12.2 / 43.8 / 34.3 /
  // 3.8 / 6.0 at line scope) because it assigned funding across the band on a
  // different schedule. Same seeds, same engine, different sample. The figures
  // here and in formatters.ts come from ONE run of one harness, which is the
  // only way the two files cannot drift apart.

  // year could read "consumed surplus" here and "strengthening surplus to $X"
  // four sentences later, both printed, both wrong to a reader trying to
  // reconcile them. Measured over 240 pool-years at member funding: 22 said
  // consumed-but-positive, 1 said supported-but-negative.
  //

  // what moves it. This one says what underwriting did, and names the exclusion
  // so the two read as a sequence rather than a disagreement.

  // with a tower would be worse than no narrative.

  // ⚠ PER LINE, FROM EACH LINE'S OWN DECISIONS AND TOWER. This is the POOLED
  // result, and it used to read `result.decisions` — which the pool copies from
  // its FIRST line — and `result.cededByLayer`, which deliberately excludes
  // Property. So a Property-only pool that bought its layer was told "No
  // occurrence layers were placed", and every pool was told of "the $1M
  // retention" although Property's lowest layer attaches at $5M and a player
  // who declines a line's first layer retains up to the next one. Each line now
  // names the attachment of its own lowest PLACED layer, from the tower itself.
