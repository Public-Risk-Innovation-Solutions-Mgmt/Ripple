/**
 * THE PRESENTATION SUBTOTALS, DERIVED ONCE.
 *
 * ⚠ EVERY FIGURE BELOW WAS BUILT TWICE — once in FinancialsPage and once in
 * CalculationAuditPage, from the same fields, with no shared helper. They agreed,
 * and nothing made them agree: a change to one surface moved that surface only,
 * which is the symptom this exists to end. Two of them were also WRONG in both
 * places, identically, which is what a single definition would have prevented.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY A SEPARATE FUNCTION AND NOT MORE FIELDS ON AnnualFinancialStatement.
 * deriveAnnualStatement is a pure field MAP — every line of it copies a stored
 * engine value under a presentation name, and that is worth keeping readable as
 * exactly that. These are DERIVATIONS: sums, splits and sign flips that exist
 * only because a statement has subtotals. Keeping the two apart means a reader
 * can tell at a glance which numbers the engine produced and which this file
 * computed, which is the distinction the audit page exists to expose.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT RETURNS THE OPERANDS, NOT ONLY THE SUBTOTALS. The audit page renders
 * the build-up of each figure, so it needs the parts; if it took the subtotal and
 * re-derived the parts to display them, the duplication would be back in the
 * place that matters most. One call, every term.

   * booking contracts it. Showing the drawn figure against a booked subtotal is a

   * Below it the reconstruction absorbed the booking bias and the give-back, so
   * the prior-year line silently carried a current-year item. The engine already
   * emits the figure; the sign is flipped because the engine signs development

   * never showed the bias markdown beside it, even though both are parts of the
   * same optimistic booking. The chain was therefore short by this term — and the
   * old prior-year line, reconstructed as `netIncurredLoss - netUltimateLoss`,
   * was absorbing exactly it. Correcting the prior-year line on its own exposed
   * the hole rather than creating it.
   *
