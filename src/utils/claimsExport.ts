// Claim-level export — a SEPARATE workbook from resultsExport.ts's summary
// export, deliberately. That one is a per-metric summary table; bolting
// thousands of claim rows onto it would make it slow and unwieldy for what it
// is actually used for. This one exists only to make the claims already sitting
// on the result objects, and the development that has landed on them,
// inspectable directly.
//
// RULING 8 STANDS: nothing here persists. This reads Claim[] off
// ResultSet.byLine[line], which is already in-memory-only (see the comment on
// LineResultSet.claims), and DevelopingClaim[] off the reserve cohorts, which
// persist for the engine's own reasons and not for this module's — it never
// regenerates, recomputes, or stores anything, it only reformats what
// processYear already produced into rows.
//
// ============================================================================
// READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING A ROW COUNT FROM THIS FILE.
//
// LineResultSet.claims (WC, GL) is ENROLLED-ONLY, not marketplace-wide, even
// though claim generation itself runs marketplace-wide. simulationEngine.ts
// generates a SEPARATE prospect draw (`prospectGenerated`) to produce
// marketMemberLossResults for the whole 200-member roster, but only merges its
// MemberLossResult summaries — prospectGenerated.claims and .occurrences are
// never read anywhere and are discarded the moment that year finishes. So
// every claim and occurrence exported here already belongs to an enrolled
// member; there is no retained prospect claim-level detail to filter out.
//
// The `enrolled` column is still a REAL membership check against each result's
// own memberLossResults, not a hardcoded true, for two reasons: it documents
// the scope explicitly on the sheet itself (per the note row), and it costs
// nothing to make correct now so that if a future engine change ever starts
// retaining prospect claims (a natural next step given how much of this
// project is marketplace-wide already), this export flags them correctly
// without being touched again.
//
// ⚠ THE PARAGRAPH THAT STOOD HERE SAID PROPERTY CONTRIBUTES ZERO ROWS BECAUSE IT
// STILL RUNS THE LEGACY AGGREGATE PATH. Property cut over to a claim-level
// generator at 645c15e and its sheet carries real rows — 2,915 occurrences over
// 8 games x 10 years when this was measured. The claim was false in both halves
// and it was the worst kind of false: it told a reader checking Property's claims
// that an EMPTY SHEET WAS NORMAL, so a genuine generator failure would have read
// as expected behaviour.
//
// ⚠ AND IT SURVIVED BECAUSE NOBODY RE-READS AN EXPORT HEADER. Six statements in
// this file were true when written and false by the time they were found, all in
// one pass. When a mechanic is retired, grep the export layer — it describes the
// engine and is never exercised by a test.

  'closed file can show less paid than its incurred. That second case is common, not an edge: closure ' +
  'runs on a count of files and payment on dollars, and the files already closed are often worth more ' +
  'than the year has paid. Status is the claim\'s own closure draw against a curve fitted to the ' +
  'pool\'s closure experience. Both are derived at read time and neither is stored. An open claim can ' +
  'still be substantially paid — but it will not have paid itself out, which the previous flat pro-rata ' +

  'is allocated from the SAME cohort figure Paid is and the two are subtractable per claim, or the ' +
  'Actuarial exhibit, where both terms come from the same ledger at the same valuation. ' +

// developing-claim record stores an OCCURRENCE total (developmentAllocation.ts
// cedes per occurrence, because the tower attaches per occurrence), while the
// line sheets are per CLAIM. Its `claimId` is the occurrence's FIRST claim —
// `o.claimIds[0]` — so joining on it would hand that one claim the whole
// occurrence's development and leave its siblings BLANK, which reads as "they did
// not develop" when they are part of an occurrence that did.
//
// Joining on occurrence id has no such failure mode: every claim in a developed
// occurrence shows the same figures, and the columns are NAMED "Occurrence ..."
// so nobody reads them as that claim's share. The alternative — apportioning the

// occurrences on all three lines: ZERO carry more than one claim, so occurrence
// and claim are the same grain and every resolution agrees. But reinsuranceTower's
// header already requires a future catastrophe to be emitted as ONE occurrence
// with many claims, and on that day a claim-id join starts misattributing
// silently. This is written for that day rather than for today.
// (The type and the walk now live in cohortViews.ts — the workbook, the claims

// ⚠ CHANGE, NOT LEVEL, IN THE YEAR COLUMNS, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE

// and unmoved" in every cell where the truth is "not valued at all". That is the
// same defect as the reserve exhibit's retired "settled" label, in a wider grid.
// A change column has a natural empty: nothing happened, so nothing is printed.
//
// ⚠ FOUR LEVEL COLUMNS BRACKET THE CHANGES, AND THE ROW IS AN IDENTITY:
//
//     Booked Occurrence + sum(Yr ...) === Current Occurrence
//     Total Development === Current Occurrence - Booked Occurrence
//
// exactly, because movementByStep records precisely the per-valuation deltas
// from the booked value onward. Drawn Occurrence sits OUTSIDE that identity:
// drawn -> booked is the optimistic markdown, taken at inception rather than at
// a valuation, so it is deliberately not one of the Yr columns.
//
// ⚠ THE COLUMNS GROW WITH GAME LENGTH AND ARE NOT CAPPED. A 10-year game
// produces 12 of them — the span runs from Yr -1, when accident year -2 takes
// its first step, to the last locked year — for 30 columns on the widest sheet.
// A 20-year game would give 22 and about 40. That is wide, and it is the right
// wide: what fills it is a DIAGONAL, because a single row can never hold more
// than its cohort's horizon of entries (12 on WC, 8 on GL, 4 on Property) no
// matter how long the game runs. The band stays a fixed width and slides right.
//
// ⚠ THE "OCCURRENCE" PREFIX BECAME A SUFFIX, AND ONLY ON THE LEVEL COLUMNS.
// It used to lead every development column — Occurrence Original, Occurrence
// Development % — and it earned that when there were four of them and a separate
// Occurrences sheet to point at. It cannot survive onto twenty year columns:
// "Occurrence Yr 7" twenty times over is noise, and a HALF-prefixed block is
// worse than none, because the unprefixed columns then read as a different
// grain. So the levels carry it as a suffix (Drawn / Booked / Current
// Occurrence), matching what the Development sheet already called its own
// columns, and the year columns carry it in the note instead.
//
// This is a real, if small, loss and it is worth being honest about: the word in
// the header was never what stopped anyone summing a column. The DEV_NOTE's
// do-not-sum warning is, and the Development sheet being the one that totals
// correctly is the actual protection. Occurrence ID also sits on every row a few
// columns to the left, so the grain is visible in the data rather than only in a
// header word.
//
// Capping was considered and rejected. Every candidate — keep the last N years,
// fold the old ones into a "Prior" column, drop years nothing moved in —
// destroys the one thing the shape is for: a column that means the same
// valuation year on every row, so the diagonal is visible and a column can be
// totalled on the Development sheet. A triangle with its early columns folded up
// is not a triangle. If the width ever becomes the binding problem, the answer
// is a narrower ROW SET (filter to developed claims), not a narrower grid.

//

// occurrence did not move this year" — whether because the cohort had matured,
// or because an adverse step went to the developing set and this is not one. A printed
// 0 is a real movement under a dollar, which the rounding is allowed to swallow.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THE CHANGE FORM GIVES UP, MEASURED. A blank cell BETWEEN two printed
// ones is a year the cohort was certainly still being valued in, so those blanks
// mean "valued and unmoved" while the leading and trailing ones mean "not
// valued". The shape cannot tell them apart. It costs almost nothing: over 6

// 54 out of 8,136 under squeezed funding (0.7%). They arise where an ADVERSE
// step went to the developing set and this occurrence is a tracked occurrence outside the developing set, so
// they thin out under squeeze — the unwind is live there, proportional, and
// moves every tracked occurrence every year. The ones that remain in that arm
// are pre-game accident years, which are written at default decisions in both
// arms and so never have an unwind.

// line exported zero paid and status 'open' — including accident years sitting
// five valuations back. The columns existed, were the right columns, and told a
// reader that nothing had ever been paid on anything.
//
// ⚠ AND THEY STAY DERIVED, BECAUSE RULING 8 SAYS SO. `LineResultSet.claims` is
// in-memory only — stripped from the save and, when absent, REGENERATED by
// claimRegeneration.ts from the roster, k, rc and year the result already
// carries (this sentence used to claim that and nothing implemented it; it does
// now, and save-round-trip-check proves the redraw exact). So a claim cannot
// ACCUMULATE paid or status across valuations. Both
// are pure functions of what the claim already carries plus its cohort's ledger:
// paid is the claim's share of the cohort's cumulative gross paid, status is its
// own closure draw against its own curve. Nothing here writes to a claim and
// nothing here persists.
//
// ⚠ ONE BASIS END TO END, AND IT IS GROSS. The claim's incurred is gross and the
// cohort ledger read here is gross, so the two columns are subtractable and their
// ratio is a gross paid-to-incurred. The NET figures on the same cohort are not
// touched by this file — see the units rule on ReserveDevelopmentRow.

// computable without its cohort-mates. The old rule WAS computable per row, and
// that was the defect rather than a convenience: pro rata by gross ultimate gave

// explicit TEXT) is left General, which is correct for text and is a visible
// omission for a number — the check below reports any numeric column that ends
// up unformatted rather than letting it pass as General.
