// ONE DERIVATION, THREE CONSUMERS — AND IT LIVES HERE SO THE OTHER TWO DO NOT
// HAVE TO READ A DISPLAY FIELD TO GET AT IT.
//
//   memberSatisfaction.ts   SHIPPED. A member's bill change against this is the
//                           part of their increase the pool has to answer for.
//   prospectCaptureRate     NOT BUILT. The recruitment ladder was retired with
//                           the membership target and membershipEngine.ts's
//                           deletion note says explicitly that it "returns with
//                           the market derivation, which satisfaction needs
//                           anyway". This is that derivation. What it still
//                           needs is a LEVEL, not a change — see below.
//   departure marketability NOT REPOINTED. memberDeparture.ts derives
//                           marketability from the credibility differential
//                           (Z_out > Z) and normalises it by the clamp. That is
//                           a statement about ONE MEMBER's shoppability and it
//                           is fully derived; this module is a statement about
//                           THE YEAR. They multiply, they do not replace one
//                           another, and pointing departure at this is a
//                           separate measurement because it moves who leaves.
//
// ⚠ THERE ARE NOW TWO QUANTITIES HERE AND THEY ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.
//
//   marketRateChangePct   what the market's rate DID this year. Derived from
//                         mean-1 components through a trailing window; the index
//                         has no absolute meaning, only its ratio does.
//   marketLevelGapPct     where the pool's price SITS against the market's.
//                         Modelled from a target loss ratio — see below.
//
// The change term alone had a hole the level closes: a pool that has been 20%
// above the market forever and holds steady shows NO rate change and costs
// nothing. A member does not compare changes. They compare their bill to what
// they would pay elsewhere, and that is a level.
//
// ⚠ AND THE LEVEL IS NOT NEUTRAL, WHICH IS THE POINT OF BUILDING IT. A carrier
// funds ABOVE expected loss for expenses and profit and a pool does not, so the
// pool holds a CUSHION it can spend before members object. That cushion is what
// gives the funding slider a price it did not have.
//
// prospectCaptureRate wants this same level and not the change —
// RATE_NEUTRAL_LOAD's own header says "a pool overpriced for five straight years
// shows NO rate change" — so the derivation below serves it when it is rebuilt.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ PURE. NO DRAWS. THIS CANNOT MOVE A BASELINE AND THE PROPERTY IS STRUCTURAL.
//
// Every component is a pure function of (line, yearNumber) and the game's own
// identifiers. `poolYearFactor` builds its own sub-stream from (seed, year) —
// the same pure function processYear already calls, so reading it here consumes
// nothing from any stream and returns the identical value. Nothing in this file
// takes a SeededRandom. A module that cannot draw cannot re-phase anything.
//
// It is also defined at EVERY integer year, including the negative pre-game
// ones, which is what makes the trailing window full from year 1 rather than
// filling over the first ten played years. A window that filled would put a
// warm-up bias into the benchmark for exactly the years a player is learning
// the game.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE WINDOW IS THE POOL'S OWN RATEMAKING WINDOW, AND THAT IS WHAT FIXES THE
// PASS-THROUGH WITHOUT A FREE CONSTANT.
//
// An accident year's cost is not a rate. The step between them is how much of
// one year's experience a ratemaker actually passes into next year's price, and
// picking that number by feel is exactly the kind of invented constant this
// repo spends its commits removing. It does not have to be picked: a carrier
// prices off an experience window, TRIANGLE_HISTORY_YEARS is the window this
// pool prices off, and a trailing mean over N years passes a single year's
// deviation through at 1/N by arithmetic.
//
// The trend passes through EXACTLY, which is the property that makes the
// benchmark usable at defaults. With only the deterministic component in the
// list, every window is the same fixed-width window one year later, so
// I(t)/I(t-1) = (1+tau) with no residual at all, at every year — and the gate
// asserts that identity to float rather than to a tolerance. A pool pricing at
// its own trend therefore reads a market gap of exactly zero, year after year,
// and any gap a player sees is a decision.
//
// THE WINDOW MEAN IS GEOMETRIC, WHICH IS THE NATURAL FORM FOR A PRODUCT OF
// MULTIPLICATIVE FACTORS: in logs the change is
//
//     log(1+tau) + [log g(t-1) - log g(t-1-N)] / N
//
// whose noise term has expectation EXACTLY 0 for any IID component rather than
// approximately 0.
//
// ⚠ AND A +0.8pp BIAS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE ARITHMETIC MEAN THIS REPLACED, AND
// THAT WAS SAMPLING NOISE READ AS A MECHANISM. Recorded because the reasoning
// was plausible and wrong. The arithmetic form is a ratio of two random sums
// sharing nine of their ten terms, E[X/Y] > E[X]/E[Y] genuinely holds, and the
// first measurement — 8 games x 10 years — read +0.78 / +0.85 / +0.81 against
// the trend on the three lines. Three lines agreeing looked like confirmation
// and is not: g_pool is ONE draw shared by all three, so the three readings are
// one observation, and its standard error at 8 games is about 0.3pp.
//
// Re-measured at 4,000 games, mean marketRateChangePct over years 1-10 against
// the trend constant, both window forms on the same draws:
//
//   line      trend     arithmetic         geometric
//   WC        -1.45     -1.3905 +/- 0.014  -1.3885 +/- 0.014
//   GL        +1.26     +1.3192 +/- 0.015  +1.3232 +/- 0.015
//   Property  -0.21     -0.1509 +/- 0.014  -0.1477 +/- 0.014
//
// THE TWO FORMS ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE and the residual +0.06pp is common to
// both, so it is not a property of the mean at all: it is E[exp] over the log
// change, sigma^2/2 with sigma = 0.029, which predicts +0.04. It is 2% of the
// benchmark's own per-year SD of 2.82pp and nothing is done about it. The
// geometric form is kept on the argument above and NOT on the measurement,
// which is the honest order.
//
// ⚠ A GEOMETRIC MEAN NEEDS EVERY COMPONENT STRICTLY POSITIVE. Both built
// components are — a power of (1+tau) and a Gamma draw — and the gate asserts
// it, because a component that could return 0 would send the index to zero and
// a negative one would send it to NaN.
//
// ⚠ AND THE BENCHMARK IS QUIETER THAN THE THING IT BENCHMARKS, WHICH IS THE
// SANITY TEST EVERY FUTURE COMPONENT HAS TO PASS. Per-year SD, 16 games x 10
// years on the engine against 4,000 games of the index:
//
//   line       market benchmark    the pool's own rate change
//   WC              2.82                     3.44
//   GL              2.90                     3.75
//   Property        2.86                     4.47
//
// A benchmark noisier than the rate it judges would make every member's
// grievance a reading of the benchmark's own draw. That is what disqualified
// the calendar component below, and market-conditions-check asserts the
// inequality so the next component cannot be added without meeting it.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ g_pool IS IN, AND THE QUESTION WAS ASKED BECAUSE IT IS ARGUABLE.
//
// Against: it is drawn from the GAME's seed, once per year, so it is this
// instance's year rather than the industry's, and only GL's generator still
// consumes it (WC's severity rebuild took it out of WC's path, and Property
// never had it).
//
// For, and this is the side taken:
//
//   1. IT IS NOT A DECISION. Nothing the player does moves it. Charging the
//      pool for it — by leaving it out of the benchmark, which is what "the
//      pool did this" means — would penalise a pool for weather. Everything
//      this benchmark exists to isolate is a decision.
//   2. A Gamma multiplier on every enrolled member of a line at once IS "a bad
//      year generally". That is the shape of a market-wide year, not of a
//      pool-specific one, whatever the draw is keyed on.
//   3. IT COSTS NOTHING TESTABLE. E[g] = 1, so including it does not move the
//      benchmark's MEAN at all — only its dispersion. And the dispersion is the
//      entire point: without a year-varying term the benchmark is a constant
//      and "a year the whole market moved" is indistinguishable from "a year
//      the pool moved alone", which is the distinction this was built for.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS APPLIED TO ALL THREE LINES THOUGH ONLY GL CONSUMES IT. Deliberate.
// The benchmark is what OTHER carriers' costs did, and a carrier writing this
// book writes more than one line. Restricting it to GL would say the WC market
// has no years, which is a stronger claim than including it.
//
// ⚠ THE ONE THING IT IS NOT: a statement that the pool's OWN losses moved. The
// pool's realised losses already contain this year's g_pool; the benchmark
// contains the same draw at 1/N through the window. Reading the gap as "the
// pool's losses minus the market's losses" is wrong — it is "the pool's PRICE
// minus what the market's price would have done".
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE CALENDAR FACTOR IS DECLARED AND NOT BUILT, AND THE REASON IS A
// MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN AN OMISSION. IT WAS THE THIRD COMPONENT ASKED FOR.
//
// The engine's calendar-year term is exactly the right SHAPE: one shared shock
// per line-year, hashed from (gameId, line, valuationYear), that every open
// cohort of a line takes together — see calendarBlendedZ and IBNER_CALENDAR_RHO.
// It is pure, it costs no draw, and reading it here would have been four lines.
//
// What is missing is its SIZE. The only magnitude available is
// reserveStepSigma(line), and that constant's own header forbids this reading:
// "THE PRODUCT IS NOT A PREDICTION ABOUT ANY OBSERVABLE. WC's effective target
// reads 0.25 x 2.80 = 0.70, and that is not a claim that a WC accident year's
// ultimate has a 60% standard deviation." It is a dial, set to make reserves
// surprise the player. Taken at face value here it puts a 20.4% standard
// deviation on WC's market restatement (sqrt(rho) x sigma = 0.2863 against a
// value-weighted open share of 0.698 over the ten-year window), i.e. it would
// claim the market's rate moves twenty points a year on calendar-year news. The
// pool's OWN measured rate jitter is 4.58% (IBNER_CALENDAR_RHO's cost table),
// so the benchmark would be four times noisier than the thing it benchmarks and
// every member's grievance would be a reading of one hashed number.
//
// THE MISSING PIECE IS A PASS-THROUGH, AND IT IS NOT THE WINDOW'S. g_pool is an
// ACCIDENT-YEAR cost and the trailing mean passes it at 1/N by arithmetic. A
// calendar-year shock RESTATES THE WHOLE TRIANGLE AT ONCE, so the window does
// not damp it, and how much of a restatement a ratemaker passes into next
// year's price is a property of the METHOD rather than of the window. Building
// it means building a market ratemaker, and inventing a single number for it
// instead is the exact move this file's window rule exists to avoid.
//
// WHAT WOULD BUILD IT: an observable for the calendar term's effect on an
// INDICATED RATE rather than on a reserve. IBNER_CALENDAR_RHO's own cost table
// has the shape of one — year-over-year log change in purePremiumPer100, null
// against shipped, 3.88% -> 4.58% on WC and flat on GL and Property — and the
// quadrature difference (2.43pp on WC) is a first candidate. It is not adopted
// here because it is measured on THIS POOL's pricing path, which is the thing
// the benchmark is supposed to be independent of.
//
// ============================================================================
// SHOCKS ARE THE FOURTH COMPONENT AND THE LIST IS THE EXTENSION POINT.
//
// Four of nine effect kinds are built (shock-check's catalog section), so a
// shock component today would describe a market that feels earthquakes and
// employment-practices surges and is blind to the other five. It drops in as
// ONE ENTRY in MARKET_COMPONENTS and nothing else changes: the index is a
// product over the list, the window is a mean over the index, and the rate
// change is a ratio of windows. No consumer of this module names a component.
//
// ⚠ THE ONE THING A NEW COMPONENT MUST BE IS MEAN 1. Everything above rests on
// it — the trend passing through exactly, g_pool costing nothing in the mean,
// the benchmark reading zero at defaults. A component with a mean away from 1
// silently retunes the neutral point, which is the defect RATE_NEUTRAL_CHANGE_PCT
// was written to prevent. market-conditions-check asserts it per component.
//
// ⚠ AND A SHOCK COMPONENT IS ACCIDENT-YEAR KIND OR CALENDAR-YEAR KIND, WHICH IS
// NOT A DETAIL. #22 Employment Practices Surge multiplies GL frequency in its
// own year — accident-year, and the window damps it at 1/N. #19 Social
// Inflation Hard Market multiplies GL severity and is the calendar-year shape.
// The second kind has the pass-through problem the calendar factor has, so the
// first half of the shock component is buildable now and the second half is not.

// prices to a target loss ratio, with expenses and profit on top of expected
// loss. The target itself is a JUDGEMENT.
//
// ⚠ AND THE EXPECTED LOSS IS THE POOL'S OWN, WHICH IS NOT THE CIRCULARITY THAT
// KILLED THE FIRST ATTEMPT. A loss cost is a property of the RISK, not of who
// carries it: the same school district generates the same claims whoever writes

// The three lines cross in different places because their own loads differ, not

//
// ⚠ AND RATE_NEUTRAL_LOAD IS STALE AGAINST THIS. It records WC 1.472 / GL 1.457
// / Property 1.521 as the load at all-default decisions; measured here the same
// quantity reads 1.405 / 1.439 / 1.426. WC is 4.6% out. That constant asks to be

// if the admin ratio changes", and several of those have. Nothing acts on it —
// its only consumer, RATE_LEVEL_SENSITIVITY, went dormant with the recruitment
// ladder — so this is a finding rather than a defect, and this file does NOT
// read it: `marketLevelGapPct` takes the live rate and the live pure premium.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE TARGET VARIES BY LINE, AND ONLY PROPERTY'S DIFFERS — FOR A MEASURED REASON.
//
// It shipped as one scalar, 0.65, set before Property carried catastrophe risk,
// and the scalar argued that three equal numbers would read like three
// measurements nobody had. That held while the three lines' own loads were
// alike. Property's cat model made them unalike, and the scalar stopped being
// neutral: Property read 2.63% DEARER than the market at Expected and +29.76% at
// 0.95, so its cushion never crossed zero and market-conditions-check's section 7
// was red on that line alone.
//
// ⚠ THE CAUSE IS THE CATASTROPHE LOAD, AND THE ENGINE ALREADY PRICES IT. The
// part of the tower's price above expected ceded loss — RISK_LOAD_LAMBDA x SD —
// is what the reinsurance market charges for volatility. Per dollar of gross
// expected loss, at defaults, 24 games x 10 years:
//
//     line       tower risk load / gross pure premium
//     WC              0.3288
//     GL              0.2865      casualty mean 0.3076
//     Property        0.4262      +0.1186 above the casualty mean
//
// A carrier writing the same Property book carries that same catastrophe load,
// through its own reinsurance or its own capital — a cat load is a property of
// the RISK, like the loss cost, and not of who writes it. So Property's market
// load is the casualty load plus that excess:
//
//     1/0.65 + 0.1186 = 1.6570   ->   target 0.6035, recorded as 0.60
//
// It is DERIVED ONCE and held, not read live. Reading the pool's own tower each
// year would make the market a function of the pool's size and layer choices —
// the circularity this file's header records killing the first attempt — so the
// constant is a fixed consequence of the cat model at default placement, and
// re-deriving it is the job of whoever moves RISK_LOAD_LAMBDA or the cat model.
//
// ⚠ WHY NOT BUILD THE MARKET FROM CARRIER EXPENSES PLUS THE TOWER LOAD ON EVERY
// LINE, which was the other option. It would split 0.65 into an expense part and
// a risk part, and the expense part has no source either — so it trades one
// judgement for a different one on ALL THREE lines, moving WC's and GL's
// crossings for a 0.04 difference in their risk loads that is inside the
// judgement already. Correcting Property alone, by the one quantity that
// actually separates it, moves nothing that was not wrong.
//
// The direction agrees with the market: short-tail property carrying a
// catastrophe load prices to a LOWER target loss ratio than casualty.
//
// ⚠ AND THE TARGET IS LOW-RISK IN A SPECIFIC WAY WORTH STATING. It does NOT set
// how hard satisfaction reacts — that scale is absorbed by the level weight, so
// a 60% target and a 70% one produce the same behaviour with a different weight.
// What it DOES set is WHERE THE CUSHION CROSSES ZERO, and the level reaction is
// kinked there (see memberSatisfaction.ts). So the number nobody has measured
// moves the crossing point, not the sensitivity.

// ============================================================================
// THE UNDERWRITING CYCLE — GL ONLY.
//
// The target loss ratio above is what a carrier INTENDS to charge for, and in
// the real world it is not a constant: it is the initial accident-year loss
// ratio, and it swings with the underwriting cycle. Milliman's US casualty
// review puts initial AY loss ratios near 80% in the late-1990s soft market and
// near 65% after the early-2000s hard market. As a PRICE that is a swing of
//
//     (1/0.65) / (1/0.80)  =  1.231,  i.e. +/-10.3% about the midpoint
//
// so the amplitude here is 0.10 and its provenance is that comparison. The
// PERIOD is 8-9 years, from Hofmann and Sattarhoff's (2023) spectral estimate
// for non-life underwriting cycles.
//
// ⚠ THE AMPLITUDE IS THE WHOLE BALLGAME AND IT WAS MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS
// BUILT. Satisfaction's response to a market price shift was measured by
// replaying the shipped anchor recursion over the engine's own move rows:
//
//     shift      GL satisfaction at year 10     in funding stops
//     -20%             -1.597                        6.58
//     -10%             -0.567                        2.34
//      +10%            +0.299                        1.23
//      +20%            +0.549                        2.26
//
// At +/-20% the swing is 8.8 stops against a whole funding slider worth 8.8 —
// the market would have been exactly as large as the player's entire pricing
// lever, and no weight anywhere could have changed that ratio, because both
// enter as a multiplicative shift of the same (1 + gap). That is why +/-20% was
// rejected.
//
// ⚠ BUT THAT TABLE IS A STATIC SHIFT AND A CYCLE IS NOT, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS
// A FACTOR OF THREE. THIS IS THE ONE NUMBER TO READ BEFORE TOUCHING THE
// AMPLITUDE. Satisfaction is a stock that closes levelHalfLifeYears toward its
// anchor, which makes it a first-order low-pass filter on anything oscillating.
// Its gain at the cycle's frequency is
//
//     |H(w)| = p / |1 - (1-p) e^(-iw)|,   p = 1 - 0.5^(1/3) = 0.2063/yr
//
//     period      8yr     8.5yr     9yr   |   3yr    5yr   10yr   20yr
//     gain      29.0%     30.5%   32.1%   |  13.3%  19.3%  35.1%  59.5%
//
// So the stock tracks under a THIRD of an 8-9 year swing. The static table's
// 2.3 stops on the soft side become a MEASURED 0.55 stops for a game that drew
// the soft half, and 0.24 stops averaged over phases. The cycle a player feels
// is a third of the cycle that is priced.
//
// That is not an argument to raise the amplitude — the amplitude is sourced and
// the attenuation is a real property of how opinion lags price. It IS the reason
// nobody should read the static sensitivity curve as this mechanism's size.
//
// ⚠ AND A CYCLE THAT IS MEAN-NEUTRAL IN PRICE IS NOT MEAN-NEUTRAL IN
// SATISFACTION. The level reaction is kinked at zero, so the soft half hurts
// more than the hard half helps and the cycle leaves a net -0.06 point (-0.24
// stop) residue on GL at defaults. The mean-one declared below is on the LOAD,
// which is the quantity that must not drift; this residue is a consequence of
// the kink and is recorded rather than corrected, because correcting it would
// mean un-kinking the reaction or centring a price cycle on a satisfaction
// outcome, and both are worse than the residue.
//
// ⚠ AND THE RESPONSE IS 3:1 ASYMMETRIC, SO THE SOFT SIDE BINDS AND +/-10% IS
// NOT HALF OF +/-20%. satisfactionLevelReaction damps NEGATIVE gaps (the pool
// cheaper than the market) by gratitudeLambda and leaves positive ones whole,
// and the resting gap is already about -4pp. A soft market pushes the gap
// through the kink into the undamped half; a hard market stays inside the
// damped one. Effective reaction at +/-20%: +21.78 soft against -7.11 hard, a
// ratio of 3.06 — measured 3.05.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ GL ONLY, AND THAT IS SUPPORTED RATHER THAN A SIMPLIFICATION.
//
// The three lines are not in the same phase and currently not even in the same
// direction: property, workers' compensation and D&O have been SOFTENING, while
// general liability continues to FIRM on social inflation — rising severity from
// litigation funding, nuclear verdicts and eroding tort reform. Putting one
// shared cycle on all three would assert a synchrony the market does not have,
// and it would also triple the phase variance every gate has to see through.
//
// So WC and Property return exactly 1 here, asserted by market-conditions-check
// rather than left to inspection. A future line-specific cycle is a second entry
// with its own amplitude and phase, not a widening of this one.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ MEAN-NEUTRAL ON THE LOAD, NOT ON THE TARGET, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS REAL.
//
// The market's rate is purePremium / target, so a cycle that is mean-1 in the
// TARGET is not mean-1 in the RATE — E[1/x] != 1/E[x]. A cycle declared on the
// target would therefore be a permanent price LEVEL shift wearing a wiggle,
// which is the exact failure the mean-one requirement exists to prevent. It is
// declared on the LOAD (1/target) instead, where the sine's mean over a full
// period is 0 by construction and the multiplier's mean is exactly 1.
//
// This is the same distinction that made the cost index's window GEOMETRIC, and
// it is asserted the same way: market-conditions-check integrates the factor
// over a period and requires 1 to float, and separately over the drawn-phase
// ensemble.
//
// ⚠ POSITIVITY. The multiplier is 1 + 0.10 sin(.), so it lives in [0.90, 1.10]
// and can never reach 0. A zero would divide the target to infinity.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE PHASE IS DRAWN, ON ITS OWN LABEL, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT A SCENARIO.
//
// A sine keyed on the year alone is not a cycle, it is a scripted backdrop:
// every game ever played would see the same slice, and "which market did your
// cohort get" would be a property of the calendar. The phase (and the period
// within its 8-9 band) is drawn once per game from
//
//     deriveSubRng(seed, 0, 'gl_market_cycle')
//
// — its OWN purpose label, never the sequential bootstrap draw, so it cannot
// re-roll an opening position or shift any existing stream. deriveSubRng hashes
// the purpose, so a new label is independent of every old one by construction.
//
// AND IT IS THE SHARED SCENARIO FOR FREE. The app's seed is
// seedFromInstanceId(instanceId), a pure function of the code a facilitator
// hands out, so every team in a room draws the SAME phase and faces the same
// market with no room record, no new field and nothing persisted. The factor is
// recomputed from (seed, year) on every read and never stored.
//
// ⚠ A FIVE-YEAR GAME SEES ABOUT 60% OF ONE PERIOD, SO IT DOES NOT AVERAGE OUT.
// That is intended: a cohort plays one market era together rather than a
// sanitised mean. It is only defensible while the phase is VISIBLE — a team
// that drew the soft half and cannot see that they did will read the model as
// unfair rather than as a scenario. Nothing renders this yet. That is the
// outstanding debt this constant carries and it should be paid before the cycle
// is used in a scored session.
// ============================================================================
