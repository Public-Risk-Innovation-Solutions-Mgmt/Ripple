// SHOCK EVENTS — the effect vocabulary.
//
// THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE: EVENTS ARE DATA, NOT CODE. There are ~40 events in
// the design matrix. If each one is a function they will drift and each will
// grow its own quirks, so what is built here is an EFFECT VOCABULARY, and the
// events themselves live in a TABLE (src/data/shockCatalog.ts). Adding event
// #23 is adding a row, not writing a generator.
//
// SCOPE. Nine effect kinds are DEFINED so the shape is right. Five are
// IMPLEMENTED (see IMPLEMENTED_EFFECTS), because only five are needed by the
// events built so far. An effect kind with no consumer is NOT silently ignored — the
// resolver throws on it (see shockResolver.ts). A shock that quietly does
// nothing is worse than one that fails loudly.
//
// RETRO HORIZON IS OUT OF SCOPE and is not represented here at all. It requires
// prior accident years to be re-valuable, which needs Phase 3 reserving.
//
// ⚠ THE REASON CHANGED SHAPE WITH IBNER AND IS WORTH RE-READING BEFORE ANYONE
// ACTS ON IT. This said "the current model carries aggregate cohorts with a
// random developmentFactor wobble, so there is nothing to reach back into".
// The wobble is gone; cohorts now carry a real IBNER state — registerSum, a
// horizon, an age, a step multiplier and a booking bias — and DO get re-valued
// each year. So prior accident years are no longer inert.
//
// That does NOT make retro horizon in scope. What is still missing is the
// ability to re-value a prior year under CHANGED PARAMETERS: IBNER walks a
// cohort's estimate forward, but the claim register behind it is pinned at the
// draw (see ReserveCohort's header on why that pinning is deliberate), so a
// retroactive shock has nothing to re-draw against. The blocker moved from "no
// reserving state" to "the register is immutable by design", which is a
// narrower and more specific obstacle. Roughly a third of the matrix waits on
// that.

  // IMPLEMENTED for Property — A FORCED CATASTROPHE. The cat band
  // (propertyCatastrophe.ts, PROPERTY_CAT_MODEL) already is an event, a region,
  // correlated member losses and one occurrence per region; this forces one
  // more of those events this year, IN A NAMED REGION, AT A STATED SIZE.
  //
  // ⚠ WHY A STATED SIZE AND NOT "DRAW ONE MORE EVENT FROM THE BAND". The band's
  // own event is the wrong magnitude for a scheduled shock: measured on eight
  // enrolled books it hits no enrolled member at all in 14%-30% of events, and
  // lands inside the matrix's $25M-$100M in only 24%-37% of them. A host who
  // schedules a major wildfire has scheduled a major wildfire. So the size is
  // drawn inside `loss`, and the region's members are hit — each at the cat
  // band's own loss-if-hit, 0.35 x primaryAssetShare x TIV — in a shock-keyed
  // order until the event reaches it. The member at the edge takes a partial
  // loss so the event lands on the drawn size exactly.
  //
  // ⚠ THE REGION IS DATA AND THE DRAWS ARE THE SHOCK'S OWN. The size and the hit
  // order come from sub-streams keyed on the SHOCK ID (`pr_force:<id>` and
  // `pr_force:<id>:<member>`), never from the cat band's streams or any
  // sequential draw, so scheduling a shock moves no other draw in the game and
  // the resolver still consumes no randomness at all.
  //
  // ONE REGION PER EFFECT, by the cat band's ruling: an earthquake spanning two
  // regions is two forceEvent effects, two occurrences, two retentions. The old
  // `span` and `intensity` fields are gone with the design that needed them.

  // members take MANY separate claims, each its OWN OCCURRENCE — `count` claims
  // drawn from the range, each of a size drawn from `claim`. The opposite of
  // forceEvent in exactly one respect, and it is the point: forceEvent sums its
  // claims into ONE occurrence the tower attaches to; this leaves every claim
  // standing alone, so none reaches the $5M retention and the pool keeps all of
  // it. NOT a catastrophe: its occurrences carry isCatastrophe false and its
  // claims the tier 'weather', so they book contracted, develop and settle like
  // any other Property claim. PROPERTY ONLY — shockCatalog rejects it elsewhere.
  | { kind: 'weatherEvent'; line: 'Property'; peril: string; region: Region; count: ShockRange; claim: ShockRange }
  // IMPLEMENTED for WC. Injects `count` claims through that line's own
  // generator, so the claims are real: they carry ids, join the occurrence
  // list, and flow into reserving and reinsurance like any other.
  //
  // ⚠ `amount` IS REQUIRED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. This used to inject "a claim
  // of tier X" and let the generator draw it. Under the mixture model that
  // silently guts the event: two claims of the heavy component drawn at its MEAN
  // is $0.19M, against the retired catastrophic tier's $17.91M — 93x smaller.
  // $9.0M is the heavy component's 99.95th percentile, not its mean. An
  // instructor-triggered event wants a REPRODUCIBLE amount, not a tail draw.
  //
  // ⚠ `accidentYearOffset` IS GONE, with WC's report lag. It BACKDATED a claim
  // so a presumption expansion could add claims dated to prior accident years,
  // which only meant anything while a deferral mechanism existed to recognise
  // them later. With every claim reported in its own accident year, a backdated
  // claim still lands in THIS year's loss — the offset changed a label and
  // nothing else once the chain-ladder that read it was removed. #10 now files
  // its three claims on enactment for the same money in the same year.
  //
  // `firstYearOnly` exists because HORIZON IS PER-EVENT, NOT PER-EFFECT. #10 is
  // future-horizon so its frequency multiplier persists forward — but enactment
  // is a one-off, and without this flag the resolver would re-inject the same
  // three claims every single year.
  //
  // ⚠ AND FOR GL, which read no injections at all until the water-system
  // contamination event needed one — the resolver bucketed them and
  // glGenerationInputs dropped them, so a GL injection would have been
  // silently inert. Property still reads none, and shockCatalog rejects one.
  //
  // RANGES, GL AND WC. `count` and `amount` may each be a ShockRange where the
  // event states a range ("two to five claims above $5M", "thirty to sixty
  // injuries"). Both lines draw them from sub-streams keyed on the shock id, so
  // nothing else in the year moves. WC draws a ranged AMOUNT LOG-UNIFORMLY — its
  // severity is heavily right-skewed (median ~$1k), so "mostly small, some
  // serious" means the geometric middle of the range, not the arithmetic one.
  //
  // `region` (WC only) confines the injured to members in the region the event
  // struck — an earthquake's injuries come from where the earthquake was. Absent,
  // the claim lands anywhere on the book, as every explicit injection always has.

  // make sprained backs rarer. The generator draws one Poisson PER COMPONENT
  // (thinning), so this multiplies a rate and the other components genuinely do
  // not move.
  //
  // SIZING: the loss multiplier is `1 + share_i x (k - 1)` where share_i is that

  // shockCatalog throws at load on a GL sevMultiplier carrying a `sub`, because
  // GL has no sub-coverages and both its draw and its analytic read only '*'.
  //
  // ⚠ A FUTURE-HORIZON sevMultiplier IS A RATCHET, and that is the intended
  // shape for a social-inflation episode. Swiss Re's index has been above zero
  // every year since 2014 — a hard market does not unwind when it ends, it
  // leaves the severity LEVEL permanently higher. So the factor is sized as the
  // CUMULATIVE excess an episode leaves behind, and the episode's duration is an
  // authoring-time input to that number rather than a runtime mechanic.
  //
  // ⚠ WHAT THIS IS NOT: an elevated TREND RATE that runs for N years and then
  // returns to baseline with the accumulated level retained. That is the
  // physically correct model and it is the eventual answer, but it needs a new
  // effect kind (a trend-rate delta with a duration) and the resolver has no
  // bounded-duration horizon at all today — `active` is
  // `horizon === 'future' || firedYear === yearNumber`, so an effect is either
  // one year or permanent. Recorded here so the ratchet is not mistaken for the
  // finished design.
  //
  // Applied through glClaimEngine's trendedMuGl log-location shift, so it shares
  // one mechanism with the severity trend and leaves sigma — and therefore the
  // per-claim CV — untouched.

  // NOT IMPLEMENTED. It was implemented for WC alone, against an allow-list

  // `presumption.ratePer1MPoliceFire`. The WC severity rebuild retired the
  // presumption process, which left the allow-list empty and every WC parameter
  // unreachable — so the mechanism was deleted rather than parked, and the
  // effect kind moved here with the other five.
  //
  // GL and Property never supported it: both compute constants at module load
