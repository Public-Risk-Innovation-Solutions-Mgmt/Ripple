// WORKERS' COMPENSATION claim-level loss model.
//
// PER-RATING-GROUP LOGNORMAL MIXTURES, fitted to the pool's own claim
// severities by EM, with per-group weights solved against the pool's own
// layered rate table. This REPLACED a four-tier structure (medical-only /
// temporary / permanent / catastrophic) whose ~65 parameters were authored as
// domain-judgment estimates and then fitted to each other over three rounds of
// calibration — internally consistent, externally unvalidated. This model is
// the first independent measurement of the book in this project.
//
// Three model-wide conventions:
//
// 1. ONE LOSS AMOUNT PER CLAIM. There are no tiers, no wage/medical legs, and
//    no annuity. A claim draws a mixture component, then a severity from that
//    component. The medical / indemnity / impairment split is GONE — it needed
//    tiers to exist. Consequences are recorded in CALIBRATION_FINDINGS.
//
// 2. NO SEVERITY TREND, AND THEREFORE NO VINTAGE PROBLEM. A claim's amount is
//    fixed at draw. The retired model carried separate 6.0% medical and 3.5%
//    indemnity trends and a single vintage-conversion point; with a report lag
//    now in the model, trending severity over the lag would make
//    E[(1+r)^lag] over an unbounded lognormal DIVERGENT — which is exactly why
//    the retired presumption process had to truncate its lag at 40 years. Not
//    trending removes the divergence, removes the truncation, and leaves the
//    severity fit as fitted.
//
// 3. FREQUENCY TREND IS A DECLINE AND THE PRICE NOW TRACKS IT. The pick is still
//    DERIVED ONCE from the neutral-book expectation and held; the pricing step
//    then multiplies it by wcFrequencyTrend(yearNumber), so the rate falls 1.5%
//    a year alongside the draw. Over a ten-year game the WC rate declines ~13%.
//
//    ⚠ THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO SAY THE PRICE DELIBERATELY DID NOT TRACK IT
//    ("unchanged from the retired model"), and that was a real defect wearing a
//    documented-intent label. The draw trended and the price did not, so losses
//    ran below the priced level BY CONSTRUCTION and the gap compounded: 93.5% of
//    expected averaged over ten years, turning an expected 100.0% combined ratio
//    into a measured 93.9%. It was inherited from the retired tier model rather
//    than chosen for this one. Do not restore it.
//
//    The held-pure-premium rule is intact. It forbids RE-DERIVING the pick each
//    year, which would double-correct against k_line and make pricing chase the
//    roster; a factor that is a pure function of the year cannot do either.

// WC SEVERITY CAP — the ceiling on a single claim.
//
// ⚠ THE ANCHOR IS THE POOL'S OWN OBSERVED MAXIMUM, which is why this is the
// best-evidenced of the three caps rather than the loosest. WC_SEVERITY_COMPONENTS
// .large records that THE POOL HAS OBSERVED CLAIMS IN THE $45-50M RANGE — that
// observation is the entire reason that component was ASSERTED rather than
// fitted, since the EM fit topped out near $9.8M once per 431 years and could
// not produce what the pool had actually seen. So the cap is set against a real
// maximum, not against a modelled one.
//
// $85M is 1.8x that observed $47M, THE SAME MULTIPLE PROPERTY USED against its
// scaled $42M. GL's $100M is deliberately NOT the reference: it has no stated
// multiple behind it (its own note says "a public-entity liability claim
// distribution with observed maxima" would displace it), so copying its number
// onto a line that HAS a real anchor would discard the better evidence.
//
// WHAT IT FIXES — three symptoms of one fact, that the mixture was unbounded:
//
//   THE DRAW. The model produced a $248.84M claim. At 1-in-5,228 full-market
//   years that is EXPECTED rather than anomalous — it is what an unbounded
//   lognormal with sigma 2.00 does — but it is 5x anything the pool has seen.
//
//   THE AGGREGATE STOP-LOSS HAD NOTHING ABOVE IT. With all layers declined WC's
//   aggregate tops out at $36.59M against unbounded severity; even fully
//   purchased the tower reaches $50M and the pool retains above that without
//   limit. retainedOccurrenceMoments carried `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` as WC's
//   ceiling for exactly this reason.
//
//   THE CALENDAR CV WAS UNMEASURABLE. It rose 28% between 50 and 120 games on
//   UNCHANGED code (0.2502 -> 0.3211), because a block bootstrap cannot
//   resample a tail event the sample never contained. That is not a noisy
//   measurement, it is an unusable one, and it is why WC's CLF re-derivation
//   question could not be settled by a CV comparison.
//
// ⚠ IT IS A CEILING, NOT A LOSS LIMIT, and it DOES inflate with the severity
// trend — same convention as GL's. This note used to say the opposite ("it does
// NOT inflate... a fixed ceiling binds harder in later years, which is what a
// practical maximum does"). That reading was reversed: a ceiling held at a
// nominal number while the distribution inflates does not model a practical
// maximum, it quietly shrinks the modelled tail by 28% over a ten-year game and
// breaks the severity-scale invariance the CLF grid's axis rests on. The
// distinction that matters is CONTRACT vs MODEL — a reinsurance attachment is a
// nominal figure the pool actually signed and must erode; a statement about how
// large a claim can be is a real-terms one. See wcSeverityCap.
//
// WHAT WOULD DISPLACE IT: the pool's large-claim history developed to ultimate
// (which is the same open item that would displace component `large` itself),
// or a statutory/structural argument for a different maximum — a state fund's
// per-claim ceiling, or an excess carrier's stated capacity. A different number
// is a one-line change here: every consumer routes through the capped analytic
// in wcClaimEngine and the single draw site in generateWcClaims.
// ⚠ THIS IS THE YEAR-1 CEILING, NOT A FIXED ONE. wcSeverityCap(year) trends it
// at wcSeverityTrend, so the ceiling is restated in each year's dollars rather
// than eroding against a rising distribution. Read this number as "$85M in
// year-1 dollars"; by year 10 the live ceiling is $117.6M.
//
// It was briefly nominal, and the reason it is not is worth keeping: a
// stationary ceiling under a 3.67% severity trend was worth $61.5M in year-1
// terms by year 10, a 28% real-terms tightening that changed the modelled
// distribution's SHAPE over a game — it broke the severity-scale invariance
// wcClfGrid's interpolation axis depends on, and it made the pricing year
// factor (the raw trend) disagree with the generator. See wcSeverityCap.

  // 1.872 where the model's is 1.448. LINE_REPORTING_PATTERN is step 2 of the
  // five-step repair: a curve, a judgement and a deriver, wired to nothing. The
  // absence this paragraph describes is still the shipped behaviour.
  //
  // It is small, and it is a real absence rather than a simplification with a
  // ruling behind it. What it costs is specific: a triangle built from this
  // model develops only through CASE movement on claims already reported, so
  // every age-to-age factor is a statement about open claims and none of it is
  // pure emergence. Anything that reasons from a factor above 1.0 on a line
  // whose claims are closed — as one reading of GL's ages 9 and 10 did — has no
  // mechanism here to explain it and should suspect this first.
  //
  // RECORDED, NOT FIXED. Reinstating it is a deferral architecture and a ruling
  // reversal, and at 6.5% by age 2 it is not what is holding the rebuild up.


  // ⚠ SHOCK-ONLY NOW. This no longer scales chronic severity — it is retained
  // as data because a regional catastrophe is a real thing for region to scale,
  // and a standing +/-5% on every claim in one region was not. Nothing in the
  // WC draw or analytic reads it; wcClaimEngine's accessor is the single door
  // a future shock should come back through.
  //
  // ⚠ AND IT WAS NEVER "MEAN-NEUTRAL BY CONSTRUCTION", which is what this said.
  // The three multipliers average to exactly 1.00; the BOOK does not. Weighted
  // by expected loss the roster's mean is 0.996983, so region was quietly
  // holding WC's expected loss 0.30% BELOW where the mixture put it.
  //
  // ⚠ AND THE PAYROLL-WEIGHTED FIGURE (0.997587, i.e. 0.24%) IS THE WRONG ONE,
  // which is worth stating because it is the intuitive one to reach for. WC's
  // loss cost is not proportional to payroll: schools carry 7.5% of payroll but
  // 2.7% of expected loss, highSafety 12.1% against 19.0%. The region mixes
  // differ across those groups — schools is 45.7% South, lowSafety 45.4% North
  // — so weighting by payroll and weighting by loss give different answers, and
  // only the loss-weighted one predicts what removing the multiplier did.

// GENERAL LIABILITY claim-level loss model — REBUILT onto a fitted per-claim
// mixture, on the WC architecture (WC_LOSS_MODEL above is the template):
// matched draw/analytic-expectation pair, RC on the draw only, held pure
// premium + annual k_GL, shared ctx.gPool (GL does not draw its own aggregate
// factor).
//
// WHAT THE ORIGINAL DESIGN-DOC MODEL HAD THAT THIS ONE DOES NOT:
//   - FOUR SUB-COVERAGES (general/epl/lawEnforcement/abuse), each with its own
//     frequency rate, pay rate, severity distribution and ALAE. DELETED. One
//     flat rate, one severity distribution, no per-type or per-sub
//     differentiation. A deliberate simplification, not an oversight — see
//     the flat-rate note below for what it costs.
//   - THE LIABILITY GATE: a latent claim-strength draw deciding pay/no-pay,
//     correlated with severity, plus an RQ-driven threshold shift
//     (rqGateGamma). DELETED. A fitted PAID-claim severity distribution has
//     no analog of an unpaid attempt to gate away — every drawn claim is
//     already a realized paid outcome. The RQ effect this threshold carried
//     does NOT reappear as a frequency recalibration (rqFrequencyBeta stays
//     at its pre-existing 0.055); it reappears below as a severity tilt.
//   - LITIGATION STAGES, stage-keyed ALAE, and GL_SOCIAL_INFLATION's
//     within-claim settlement-lag trend. DELETED, all together. The fitted
//     mixture includes ALAE and comes from a real pool's real claim
//     experience — whatever settlement-lag trending happened historically is
//     already realized in those dollar amounts. Trending on top would
//     double-count, the identical reasoning that retired the statutory cap
//     below. GL carries no severity or frequency trend of any kind as a
//     result — see exposureTrend.ts's GL note.
//   - THE STATUTORY CAP (indemnity-only, state-law-only) and the
//     indemnity/ALAE/legalBasis split it needed. DELETED. It was applied in
//     the waterfall, downstream of generation, against a severity that was
//     itself an invented parameter with no claim on reality beyond internal
//     consistency. The fitted mixture instead comes from a pool that already
//     operated under real statutory caps — a second cap on top would
//     suppress claims that were never able to exceed it in the first place.
//     One real, named consequence: a capped claim could previously still
//     pierce the $1M retention on ALAE alone even with near-zero indemnity.
//     Nothing replaces that; it is a genuine loss, not an absorbed one.
//   - MULTI-CLAIMANT ABUSE BATCHES. DELETED ENTIRELY, not layered on top of
//     the mixture. This was reconsidered after measurement, not assumed: the
//     71.8%/71.5% (full-market/enrolled) share of >$25M occurrences that were
//     batch accumulations, and the 185-claimant reference case, both traced
//     to external anchors rather than this pool's own claim experience —
//     which tops out around 15 claimants — and the fitted mixture is on
//     INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, which already include whatever abuse-type claimants
//     exist in the pool's real data. Occurrence == claim for GL now, exactly
//     as WC's is. Measured consequence of dropping batches: occurrences
//     above $25M fall to 0.236/yr (one per 4.2 years) — see the verification
//     targets below and the tower-rederivation diagnostic that measures it
//     against a live generator rather than treating it as a shortfall.
//
// WHAT SURVIVES: the RQ FREQUENCY channel (rqFrequencyBeta, unchanged), the
// per-member-year frequency noise, and k_GL / held-pure-premium / RC-on-draw-
// only exactly as before. One thing is NEW versus the original design: an RQ
// SEVERITY tilt (rqSeverityBeta below), added to partially restore what the
// deleted gate's RQ-threshold channel contributed.

//   binds                 1 per 27 years full-market, 1 per 103 years at the
//                         enrolled book, 0.3557 per 10,000 claims
// The POINT IS THE VARIANCE, not the mean: it removes 5.0% of expected loss
// and MORE THAN HALF the annual CV. The bind rate is the acceptance test —
// not more than once in a long run — and 103 years clears it the same way
// $100M's 137 did; a five-year game has roughly a 4.8% chance of ever seeing
// one bind. Property's own binding cap looks like a claim landing at exactly
// $75,000,000.00; GL's looks the same way, 11 of 310,431 sampled claims
// sitting exactly at $84,000,000.00.
//
// ⚠ THE ANCHOR IS UNTOUCHED, AND THAT IS CHECKED. GL's frequency was derived
// from the 0-$1M loss cost of 2.83 per $100, and E[min(X,$1M)] cannot see a
// $100M cap: min(min(X, 100M), 1M) === min(X, 1M) identically. So
// E[min(X,$1M)] stays $35,920 and ratePer1M stays 0.7879. NOT re-derived.
//
// ⚠ NOT A PRECEDENT FROM WC, contrary to how this ruling was framed. WC's
// $15.51M ceiling was a property of the RETIRED annuity model (see
// reinsuranceTower.ts:145 and CALIBRATION_FINDINGS "the mixture has no
// ceiling"); the CURRENT WC mixture is explicitly UNCAPPED, with its 1-in-250
// -year claim at $71.2M and the absence of a cap recorded as an open item at
// WC_SEVERITY_COMPONENTS.large. This was the FIRST severity cap in the live
// model and for a while left WC and GL on different footings; WC is bounded
// too now and its own ceiling still trends (wcSeverityCap) — GL's stopped
// (below), so the two are no longer on the same footing again, and that is
// this file's decision, not an oversight.
//
// WHAT WOULD DISPLACE IT: a public-entity liability claim distribution with
// observed maxima, or a verdict study establishing a realistic ceiling. A
// different number is a one-line change here — every consumer routes through
// expectedClaimSeverity (analytic) and the single draw site in glClaimEngine.
//
// ⚠ $84M, FLAT — REVERSED FROM A TRENDING $100M, DELIBERATELY, AND THE PRIOR
// REASONING STILL HOLDS. This was $100M trending at GL's own severity trend
// (5.7026%/yr) specifically because a stationary ceiling was worth $60.7M in
// year-1 terms by year 10 (a 39% real-terms tightening) and broke the
// severity-scale invariance glClfGrid's interpolation axis depends on — see
// glClaimEngine.ts's expectedClaimSeverity for that argument in full. Neither
// cost is refuted here. It is reversed because a claims export showed a
// $124,836,814.95 claim in accident year 5, under a ceiling that had already
// grown from $100M to $127.6M by then — a worst case that grows every year is
// one nobody can state, which is a real requirement the trending version
// could not meet no matter how well-justified its trend was.
//
// $84M IS NOT $100M RE-DERIVED; IT IS SIZED TO THE TOWER. GL retains $1M and
// the tower tops at $25M (the real programme's own figure), so the pool nets
// gross-minus-$24M above $25M. At $84M gross the pool retains exactly $60M —
// the largest GL claim the real book has seen. The tower is unchanged; this
// is the cap alone.
//
// THE SHAPE-DRIFT COST, MEASURED RATHER THAN LEFT IMPLICIT (gl-claim-check.ts
// section 2c has the full table): the capped year factor falls below the raw
// severity trend again — a 0.24% gap by year 2, 2.52% by year 10, 6.50% by
// year 20 (was exactly 0 under the trending cap). k_GL's trend-invariance
// tolerance is loosened back from 1e-12 to 1e-4 for the same reason it was
// loosened the first time this cap was fixed. The capped per-claim CV, no
// longer asserted invariant, drifts -11.97% by year 10 and -24.20% by year 20
// (REPORTED, not gated — same treatment it had before the trending fix).
// glClfGrid's own interpolation AXIS (claim count, not CV) is unaffected by
// any of this, per its header; what is not fully insulated is the grid's
// STORED RATIOS, measured once by single-year draws on a premise that no
// longer holds exactly. Whether that gap matters over a played game (not the
// 20-year table above) is a pure-premium/CLF-table question, reported
// separately rather than re-derived here.
//
// THE WORST POSSIBLE GL CLAIM IS NOW A STATABLE NUMBER: $84,000,000 gross, the
// pool retains $60,000,000 on it. Measured against 50 ten-year games (default
// three-line configuration): typical ending surplus median $94.28M, mean
// $96.62M, p10 $59.09M. A single worst-case GL claim's retained cost is 63.6%
// of a typical game's ENTIRE ending surplus, and would exceed it outright in
// the worst-performing tenth of games (p10 $59.09M < $60M). This is not a
// number the trending cap could ever have produced — the equivalent year-10
// figure under $100M-trending was a moving target by construction.

 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WHY, AND IT IS ABOUT PROVENANCE RATHER THAN ABOUT THE MECHANISM.
 *
 * The voluntary count is book x (1 - retentionProb), and retentionProb is
 * BASE_RETENTION plus a small adjustment. So the whole outflow of the pool was
 * set by the 0.95 directly above, which:
 *
 *   - traces to 116b96d, the root commit, "Add files via upload". It predates
 *     this repository's history and has never been derived IN it.
 *   - carries one line of justification: "high by default for realistic public
 *     entity pools". No measurement, no source, no sensitivity.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS NOT THE bdc98ec FAMILY, WHICH IS THE COMPARISON THAT MIGHT
 * OTHERWISE BE DRAWN. RATE_RETENTION_SENSITIVITY and its two siblings also
 * arrived without derivation, but they arrived with a worked table, a stated
 * scale and an explicit "adopted as given rather than re-derived — there is no
 * measurement in this model that could pin a member's price elasticity, so it
 * is a judgment, and it is recorded as one". BASE_RETENTION has none of that.
 * It is older and thinner.
 *
 * That was survivable while intake was open and the two flows crossed somewhere.
 * It stops being survivable once No New Business is a default appetite: with
 * nothing coming in, an undeclared constant would be the SOLE determinant of the
 * book's trajectory for the whole game.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a judgement that pools have no voluntary
 * turnover, and it is not a deletion. A voluntary mechanism goes back in, and it
 * will be DERIVED when it does.
 *
 * Everything the later mechanism needs is left standing and still runs every
 * year: memberDeparture.ts's model, the marketability term derived off the
 * credibility differential, the sort key, calcRetentionProbability and its five
 * weights, and the satisfaction plumbing. The only thing this flag changes is
 * how many members are taken off the sorted list — see simulateMemberMovement,
 * which still computes the list and still takes every draw.
 *
 * ⚠ READ updateSatisfaction's OWN NOTE BEFORE BUILDING THAT MECHANISM. The
 * pool-level satisfaction scalar is quantised to one decimal while its annual
 * movement is an order of magnitude smaller, so it cannot currently respond to
 * anything. A voluntary model that reads satisfaction would be reading a
 * constant. That is recorded at the defect rather than here.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ⚠ WHAT TURNING IT BACK ON COSTS, SO NOBODY FLIPS IT CASUALLY. Both baselines

 * onward. Flipping this is a recapture commit either way.

 *
 * ⚠ NO LINE IS IMMUNE. All three price off the same experience path; Property
 * is only where it was first measured.
 *
 * The insolvency that follows is NOT the defect — a player who retains and
 * loses has taken a risk and lost, which is the lesson. The defect was the
 * model PAYING them to take it. With the charge flat, declining is a pure
 * volatility bet: the reinsurer's margin stays in the pool and funds the

 *
 * ⚠ EVERY FIGURE ABOVE WAS MEASURED BEFORE THE PROPERTY MERGE, ON A PROPERTY
 * TOWER OF THREE LAYERS WITH NO CATASTROPHES. That merge collapsed Property's
 * tower to ONE layer ($995M xs $5M) and made catastrophes book at full cost on
 * a single shared occurrence, so the full-tower price, the cession and both
 * ratios are all different quantities now. RE-MEASURED on the merged engine,
 * same 12 x 10 design, whole occurrence tower placed against none placed:
 *
 *   line        charge at the decision     10-year mean      margin when declined
 *     WC                  -2.7%                 +1.1%              $9.81M
 *     GL                  -4.1%                 +6.5%             $20.57M
 *     Property            -3.0%                 +3.3%             $31.33M
 *
 * The mechanism survived the merge UNCHANGED, and that is not luck: the
 * reference placement is built by reading each layer's own `purchasable` flag
 * (FULL_OCCURRENCE_PLACEMENT), so collapsing three layers into one re-prices it
 * without touching this code. The drift is the same drift, slightly larger
 * because Property now cedes more. Both ratios still agree across the two arms
 * (WC 43.1 / 42.7 pool and 27.6 / 27.4 total; GL 31.5 / 29.4 and 19.9 / 19.1;
 * Property 71.4 / 68.0 and 45.6 / 44.4), which is the property that says the
 * charge and the cession are being read on the same basis.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE TRADE CHANGED SHAPE, WHICH IS THE MERGE'S REAL NEWS. Before the
 * merge, declining everything dominated on BOTH return and safety — more
 * surplus AND fewer insolvencies — which inverted the intended lesson. With
 * Property's catastrophes in, the safety half flips: over 12 ten-year games,
 * the declined arm takes ONE insolvency and the placed arm takes NONE. The
 * volatility a player buys out of is finally real. The RETURN half has not
 * flipped — mean ending surplus is $821.26M declined against $134.89M placed —
 * so declining is now a genuine risk-for-return trade rather than a free lunch,
 * but it is still a trade priced far in the player's favour. That is the
 * tower's load (RISK_LOAD_LAMBDA = 0.60), not this margin, and it is a
 * calibration question this constant deliberately does not answer.
 *
 * WHY IT DRIFTS: once the cover is declined the pool keeps every loss, so its
 * own triangle learns the GROSS loss cost. The retained rate climbs toward
 * gross — correctly — and the margin added on top then charges the ceded
 * portion a SECOND time. The drift is therefore zero at the moment the decision
 * is made and grows with the number of declined years inside the ten-year
 * pricing window. It is worst on GL, whose cession share is the largest.
 *
 * ⚠ THE EXACT FIX IS A LEDGER FIELD, AND IT IS NAMED HERE SO NOBODY HAS TO
 * REDISCOVER IT. ReserveDevelopmentRow would carry the cession rate that
 * applied to ITS OWN accident year — one scalar per row, stamped when the row
 * is written, where `expectedCededPer100` is already in hand. The margin would
 * then be added only for the part of the window still priced on net experience,
 * and the drift would be zero at every age. A gross SERIES was considered for
 * that row and rejected because it cost a second array; one scalar does not.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE TWO ALTERNATIVES WERE MEASURED AND ARE WORSE. Grossing up at a
 * FIXED reference placement reads +26.5% (WC), +48.7% (GL), +15.6% (Property)
 * against the true gross at year 10 — it grosses up a triangle that already
 * contains the gross losses. Adding only the reinsurer's LOAD rather than the
 * whole price reads -20.9% / -30.6% / -18.0% at year 1, wrong exactly where the
 * decision is taken. This rule is the only one of the three that is right where
 * it matters.
 *
 * ⚠ THE OCCURRENCE TOWER ONLY. The aggregate stop's price is a function of the
 * layer selection, so "what the aggregate would have cost" is not defined when
 * the layers underneath it are declined. The margin is the price of the
 * declined OCCURRENCE layers and nothing else.

// to equal expected departures at N* = 63, which made the enrolled book a
// quantity the model STEERED TOWARD rather than an outcome of who applies, who
// clears the bar and who leaves.
//
// ⚠ EVERY MEASUREMENT TAKEN AGAINST THEM MEASURED THE TARGET, NOT THE
// MECHANISM. "Growth is unreachable at any cap", "intake runs 2.6/yr against
// withdrawals of 2.65-2.94", "the book holds near 62" — all true, all
// consequences of a constant, and all now void. Anything in this file still
// reasoning from a book near 62 is stale by construction; clfTables.ts is the
// one that matters and carries its own re-derivation note.
//
// WHAT REPLACES THEM: nothing on the demand side. Intake is supply — a share of
// the unenrolled marketplace applies (APPLICATION_RATE), the appetite bar
// filters them, everyone who clears is written up to the capacity guard.
// Departures stay proportional. The two flows cross where
//
//     APPLICATION_RATE x (roster - N)  =  N x (1 - retention)
//
// which is an emergent fixed point, not a target. A book settling there is two
// flows meeting; a book settling at 63 would mean something is still steering.
// See membership-flows-report.
// ============================================================================

// ⚠ MAX_NEW_MEMBERS_PER_YEAR AND MAX_WITHDRAWN_PER_YEAR ARE BOTH DELETED.
//
// MAX_NEW_MEMBERS_PER_YEAR = 4 capped a demand term that no longer exists.
//
// MAX_WITHDRAWN_PER_YEAR = 4 WAS A GROWTH ACCELERATOR, and that is the finding
// worth keeping. Departures are PROPORTIONAL — book x (1 - retention) — while
// the cap was a flat count. At 62 members expected departures are 2.76 and the
// cap only clipped the noise tail; at 120 they are 5.34 and it would have bound
// almost every year, suppressing roughly 1.3 departures annually. The brake
// weakened exactly as it was needed most, so the first growth arm measured would
// have run away and would have looked like the intake model doing it.
//
// ⚠ NOTHING REPLACES THE OUTFLOW CAP, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. A share cap would
// be the right FORM, but there is nothing left to cap: calcRetentionProbability
// already clamps retention to [0.80, 0.99], so departures cannot exceed a fifth
// of the book in any year however bad it gets, and the noise multiplier is
// bounded at 1.6. A second bound over a bounded quantity only hides the first.

/**
 * THE CAPACITY GUARD — the most members the pool will onboard in one year, as a
 * share of its own book. The only limit left on intake.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS A JUDGEMENT AND THERE IS NO MEASUREMENT BEHIND THE NUMBER. Said
 * plainly, in the house style that separates the two: the FORM is defensible
 * and the VALUE is not derived. Onboarding capacity — underwriting time, board
 * approval, getting a new member's data in — is a real constraint and it scales
 * with the size of the organisation, so a share is the right shape and a flat
 * count is not. But nothing in this model can produce the number: there is no
 * staffing, no expense per new member, no onboarding cost line. Ten percent is
 * a plausible ceiling asserted, not a figure fitted.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT NOW BINDS, WHICH IT NEVER DID BEFORE. Under the old model the flat
 * cap of 4 was always tighter and this fired in 0% of line-years. With the flat
 * cap gone it is the only intake limit, and it binds whenever applications
 * exceed a tenth of the book — which the arithmetic says happens below about 75
 * members:
 *
 *     APPLICATION_RATE x (roster - N)  >  MAX_NEW_MEMBER_SHARE x N
 *     0.06 x (200 - N) > 0.10 x N   =>   N < 75
 *
 * So it shapes the EARLY growth path of a pool accepting everyone and then
 * stops binding. new-business-appetite-derive reports how often it actually
 * fires per tier; if it turns out to bind throughout, it is steering the book
 * and this value needs an argument it does not currently have.
 */
export const MAX_NEW_MEMBER_SHARE = 0.10;

/**
 * THE APPLICATION RATE — the share of the unenrolled marketplace that applies
 * to this pool in a given year. DERIVED — see the sweep below.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS: THE OLD MODEL SHOWED THE POOL ~140 APPLICANTS FOR 4 SLOTS.
 * Every unenrolled, cooled-off member of the 200-strong marketplace was treated
 * as an applicant every year. No real pool has a 35:1 applicant-to-slot ratio,
 * and the consequence was that New Business Appetite could not do anything: even
 * the strictest bar left 35-49 members clearing it against an intake of 4, so
 * the bar only ever chose WHICH applicants the draw reached, never HOW MANY. The
 * measured book across all four tiers read 58.8 / 58.2 / 58.4 / 58.1.
 *
 * With applications a small share of the unenrolled pool, a strict bar can leave
 * the pool SHORT OF ITS OWN QUOTA — and that is the point at which "accept
 * everyone" and "be picky" become different decisions rather than the same book
 * with two members swapped.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS IS NOT, RECORDED SO IT IS NOT REDISCOVERED AS AN OVERSIGHT. The
 * realistic model is two-stage: a district goes shopping because its OWN
 * experience turned bad, and then chooses this pool on price. That produces
 * adverse selection from the mechanism instead of by imposition, and it is the
 * refinement this single number would become.
 *
 * It was considered and rejected, twice over. It makes EVERY applicant
 * adversely selected unless a tilt parameter is calibrated to say how much of
 * the shopping decision is bad experience and how much is price — and nobody
 * has measured that parameter. And it is a great deal of machinery for a
 * result one percentage reaches. Revisit it with a measurement of the tilt, not
 * with an argument about realism.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * ⚠ RE-DERIVED AFTER THE MEMBERSHIP TARGET CAME OUT. THE VALUE DID NOT MOVE
 * AND THE REASONING IS ENTIRELY REPLACED.
 *
 * 6% was first derived against ONE condition: make the appetite tiers grade, by
 * leaving a strict bar short of a fixed quota. That was the right question while
 * the book was held level. With the target and the intake count cap deleted the
 * rate does a different job — it SETS THE BOOK'S TRAJECTORY — so it was swept
 * again against three questions it had never been asked.
 *

 *
 *   CAN A POOL THAT ACCEPTS EVERYONE GROW? Yes. At 6% the book runs 79 -> 97,
 *   growing THROUGHOUT rather than plateauing — the year-by-year trajectory
 *   climbs in every one of the fourteen years.
 *
 *   CAN A PICKY ONE SHRINK TO A PROBLEM? Yes. At 6% the strict bar runs
 *   76 -> 63, and at 3-4% it reaches 50-56, which is a pool in trouble.
 *
 *   IS EITHER THE ACCIDENT OF A CONSTANT? No, and the guard column is how that
 *   is checked. Above 8% the capacity guard binds in 30-93% of line-years on
 *   Accept All, which means the GUARD is setting the trajectory rather than the
 *   flows — the failure mode this whole change exists to remove, reappearing in
 *   a different constant. At 6% it binds in 6% of years and only early.
 *
 * 6% is the rate at which both directions are real and neither is the guard's
 * doing: +23% over fourteen years accepting everyone, -16% being strict, and a
 * guard that acts in one line-year in sixteen.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE PLATEAU TEST PASSES. See membership-flows-report: the measured
 * crossing lands at 107 (Accept All), 73 (below 1.00) and 55 (below 0.75)
 * against predicted 109 / 80 / 62. NO TIER SETTLES NEAR 63, which is what the
 * deleted target would have looked like. The book is an outcome.

// ⚠ "INTENTIONALLY MODEST SO INVESTMENT INCOME DOES NOT DOMINATE UNDERWRITING
// RESULTS" STOOD HERE AND IS NO LONGER TRUE. That WAS the design intent and it
// is worth keeping on the record, because the way it broke matters more than

//
// Measured across 30 games at CLF 0.45, investment income as a multiple of
// |underwriting income|:
//
//     WC 1.12x        GL 0.66x        Property 0.40x
//
// and the share of underwriting-NEGATIVE line-years that still grew surplus:
//
//     WC 52%          GL 43%          Property 14%
//
// On WC the float now out-earns the underwriting result outright.
//
// ⚠ THE RATE DID NOT MOVE. THE DENOMINATOR DID. Not one parameter below has
// changed. The payout patterns roughly doubled the reserve, the reserve IS the
// invested base, so the float this same rate applies to roughly doubled with
// it. The intent broke because the thing it was set against moved underneath
// it — nobody loosened it.
//
// ⚠ "REVIEWED AND DELIBERATELY LEFT" STOOD HERE AND IS NO LONGER THE POSITION.
// The paragraph is kept because its argument is still correct and is the reason
// the cut below is NOT described as a correction: 5.28% net, with bonds at 5.20%
// gross, was a defensible short-duration investment-grade posture on its own
// terms, and the dominance arrived through a CORRECT change to the reserve.
// Cutting returns to restore an intent whose premise had moved would have been
// correcting a right thing with a wrong one. The dominance is also not
// implausible: a long-tail pool with a large float genuinely can absorb
// underwriting losses for years, which is cash-flow underwriting, and it is the
// mechanism that makes reserving matter now that the ending-position panel shows
// what is still owed. None of that has been shown to be wrong.
//
// WHAT CHANGED IS THE QUESTION. The returns are now scaled by
// INVESTMENT_RETURN_SCALE to model a LOWER-RATE MARKET — see its own note. That
// is a choice about what market the game is set in, not a finding that the old
// figures were mis-measured, and the baseline they are scaled from is still the
// unsourced one described next.
//
// ⚠ AND THE PARAMETERS CITE NO SOURCE. "Whole-period historical values that
// already include crash years" names no index, no period and no study, here or
// in the commit that introduced them (406fba9). They are considered numbers, not
// sourced ones. A reader should not assume there is a reference behind them, and
// anyone who wants to move them is choosing against judgement rather than
// against data. Scaling them does not make them sourced: the figures below are a
// deliberate third under an unsourced baseline, which is a stated choice resting
// on an unstated one.
//
// ⚠ THE "restates this table downstream rather than sourcing it" CLAUSE IS GONE
// BECAUSE THE DEFECT IS. investmentMemo.md no longer carries the numbers: it
// carries {{ASSET_CLASS_TABLE}} and {{DEFAULT_ALLOCATION}}, filled from these
// constants by src/utils/investmentMemo.ts. The audit page always read them.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE OPEN ITEM IS THE ALLOCATION, NOT THE RATE.
//
// AllocationBar is a free 0-100% control across the three classes, so the
// reachable mean spans 2.75% (all cash) to 5.38% (all equities) — it was 4.15%
// to 8.14% before INVESTMENT_RETURN_SCALE, and the figures below are the
// PRE-SCALE ones, left as measured rather than rescaled on paper. The SPREAD
// narrows with the means (3.99 points to 2.63) while the volatility does not
// move at all, so the open item below gets SMALLER at the lower rate: the same
// ±$16.3M of noise now buys about two-thirds as much expected gain. The
// conclusion is unchanged and slightly less sharp.
//
// NOTHING PRICES THE VOLATILITY except insolvency. On a $40M float over five
// years, AT THE PRE-SCALE RATES:
//
//     default 10/80/10   E +$10.6M    SD  $3.3M
//     all equities       E +$16.3M    SD $16.3M
//
// so switching buys about +$5.7M in expectation against ±$16.3M of noise. For a
// player judged on ending surplus, with no penalty attached to the spread, that
// is simply the correct play — at which point the allocation stops being a
// decision and becomes a right answer.
//
// ⚠ THE MISSING PIECE IS ALREADY NAMED IN THE MEMO: "no liquidity requirement
// or early-sale cost is currently applied." That is the live gap, the doubled
// float made it bigger, and SHOCK EVENTS LAND ON TOP OF IT — a claim spike
// against a 100% equity book with no cost to selling into it is precisely the
// scenario a liquidity requirement exists to model. Fix that before revisiting
// anything below.

 * A LOWER-RATE MARKET. Every asset class's MEAN return is scaled by this; the

 *
 * ⚠ IT IS A SCALAR AND NOT THREE REWRITTEN LITERALS, SO THAT THE BASELINE STAYS
 * VISIBLE AND THE NEXT CHANGE IS ONE NUMBER. The unsourced figures above are
 * still in the file, still unsourced, and the relationship to them — exactly a
 * third lower — is stated rather than buried in three decimals. A reader can see
 * both what was chosen and what it was chosen against.
 *
 * ⚠ A THIRD, NOT A HALF, AND THE REASON IS WHERE THE EFFECT SITS. The first cut
 * does about two-thirds of the total available effect: today to a third lower
 * drops the net blend 1.76 points, a third lower to half drops it only 0.88.
 * Surplus, underfunding and the reinsurance gap all move most in the first step.
 * It also keeps the market legible — a losing portfolio year goes from about one
 * in thirteen to about one in six, where halving would make it one in four and
 * start to make results look random.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT LANDS AT, AND WHY IT IS NOT 3.53%. Scaling the GROSS means while
 * holding the fees puts the default 10/80/10 blend at 3.4877% net, against
 * 5.2894% before — down 1.80 points. 3.53% is what the blend would be if the
 * FEES scaled too (5.2894 x 2/3 = 3.5263), and they do not: a fee is a charge on
 * assets under management, not a share of the return, so it does not fall
 * because the market does. The 0.04-point difference IS the unscaled fee drag.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE CLAMPS DID NOT MOVE EITHER. minReturn and maxReturn are sanity rails
 * rather than parameters, and at the lower means they bind less often, not more
 * — cash's 0% floor sits 6.9 SD below a 2.79% mean where it sat 10.5 SD below
 * 4.19%. Left alone deliberately; moving a rail to match a mean would make it a
 * parameter.

// TIV exposure base does not inflate while its losses do (WAGE_INFLATION_APPLIES
// .Property is false). Penalising the RAW rate change would therefore be a
// permanent tax on Property and a permanent subsidy to WC, at defaults — which

// and once by this constant's own retired comment.
//
// The pre-game is a reject-and-redraw search: runLinePreGame simulates a
// candidate three-year past, tests its ending surplus against
// OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND, and redraws until one lands inside. This
// constant sets where that search STARTS. The BAND sets where it LANDS. They are
// a proposal distribution and a target, and moving the proposal changes the
// ACCEPTANCE RATE, not the answer.
//
// MEASURED, so it is not a story. Doubling each pin in turn and re-running the
// solo pre-game. These are pin-vs-band-check.ts's own readings; that gate
// asserts the PROPERTY rather than these exact figures, so re-run it rather than
// trusting the table if a band or a pin moves. Re-measured at the shipped
// 0.41 / 0.27 / 0.41:
//
//   line       accepted opening surplus/premium   mean redraw attempts
//   WC              1.044 -> 1.083   (+3.7%)          1.93 -> 16.60    (8.6x)
//   GL              1.454 -> 1.531   (+5.3%)          1.52 -> 12.65    (8.3x)
//   Property        1.463 -> 1.487   (+1.6%)          2.92 -> 10.22    (3.5x)
//
// (At the retired pins the same table read 1.034 -> 1.104 / 1.433 -> 1.602 /
// 1.431 -> 1.521 on the opening and 2.20 -> 67.90 / 1.75 -> 7.90 / 3.17 ->
// 14.55 on attempts. The RELATIONSHIP is what the gate asserts; the digits move
// with every re-centring and are a reading, not a target.)
//
// A 100% MOVE IN THE PIN BUYS A 2-6% MOVE IN THE OPENING AND MULTIPLIES THE
// REDRAW BILL. It was found the other way round, at the retired values: doubling
// GL's old pin of 0.45 moved its opening 1.1% and took the mean attempt count
// from 11.8 to 108.2, with a worst case of 481 against a MAX_HISTORY_ATTEMPTS of
// 500 — within 4% of the search failing outright.
//
// SO THE CALIBRATION TARGET IS THE CENTRING, and the redraw bill is its symptom.
// Each value is the K that centres its line's UNFILTERED opening distribution on
// its own band's midpoint, so the band accepts near the mode instead of out in a
// tail. Measured with the band disabled, the median opening is affine in K:
//
//   WC        surplus/premium ~ 0.2059 + 2.1214 K   band midpoint 1.025  ->  0.41
//   GL        surplus/premium ~ 0.4306 + 4.1063 K   band midpoint 1.510  ->  0.27
//   Property  surplus/premium ~ 0.1296 + 3.3089 K   band midpoint 1.415  ->  0.41
//
// (300 seeds at each of five K per line, R^2 0.9988 / 0.9997 / 0.9998. The fits
// recorded here before this commit — -0.014 + 2.227K, 0.531 + 4.132K, 0.033 +
// 2.889K, giving 0.47 / 0.24 / 0.48 — were the same measurement against an
// earlier engine and are superseded, not corrected.)
//
// The basin is broad, not a knife edge — GL measured 2.15 / 2.21 / 2.01 / 1.91 /
// 1.95 mean attempts at K = 0.20 / 0.22 / 0.24 / 0.26 / 0.28 — so the fitted
// value is kept rather than the sample minimum, which would be fitting noise.
//
// ⚠ THE SLOPE IS SOLID AND THE LEVEL IS NOISY, WHICH IS HOW TO RE-SOLVE THIS.
// R^2 above 0.998 makes the slope reliable, but the median itself is a sample
// statistic: bootstrap SE at 800 seeds is 0.015 / 0.031 / 0.046, so a 300-seed
// fit can place the level ~0.05 off and the first solve from these fits
// overshot every line by about that much. The method that worked: solve from the
// fit, then measure the median at that K on a LARGE INDEPENDENT seed base and
// take one Newton step, `K += (midpoint - median) / slope`. Validated at 800
// fresh seeds, the shipped values land +0.015 / -0.003 / +0.022 from their
// midpoints — 1.0 / 0.1 / 0.5 standard errors, i.e. centred within noise.
// opening-centring-check asserts this property on every run.
//
// WHY THIS IS WORTH A COMMIT: the pre-game runs at the start of every session and
// fifty opening positions are to be precomputed, so an attempt is setup time paid
// fifty times over. 150 solo seeds per line, mean attempts, at the ORIGINAL
// re-centring:
//
//   WC 7.25 -> 1.63    GL 10.57 -> 1.87    Property 4.81 -> 2.99
//   pool total 22.63 -> 6.49 candidate pre-games per opening, a 71% cut
//
// ⚠ AND IT HAS NOW DRIFTED TWICE, WHICH IS WHY THERE IS A GATE. This is a
// property of the constant AGAINST AN ENGINE, and payout patterns, closure
// curves and the per-claim payment split all moved it after it was last set.
// Found the first time at 995f6f9 while re-reading the constant; found the
// second time while measuring something else entirely (the cost of a deeper
// pre-game), by which point the unfiltered median sat +0.19 off its midpoint on
// WC and +0.29 on Property — roughly half of each band's width, so half the
// candidate distribution was rejected at the CEILING and the accepted set came
// from the low tail. The pool was shipping systematically weaker openings than
// the engine's own distribution gives, and nothing downstream could see it
// because every accepted opening is inside the band by construction.
//
// The redraw bill barely moved across the second drift (2.9 / 2.6 / 4.0 attempts
// against 2.20 / 1.75 / 3.17 recorded), which is exactly why cost is the wrong
// thing to watch: the SELECTION BIAS is the damage and it is invisible in
// attempt counts. opening-centring-check asserts the centring directly, so the
// next engine change trips a gate instead of the drift being found a month later
// by someone measuring something else.
//
// ⚠ THE OLD VALUES WERE 0.70 / 0.45 / 0.18 AND THEIR COMMENT APOLOGISED FOR
// HAVING NO RATIONALE. The apology was for the absence of a rationale this
// constant never needed: it went looking for a per-line CAPITAL argument (tail
// length, volatility) to justify an ordering, found none, and recorded the
// failure. There was nothing to find, because the ordering was never carrying
// line-specific capital information — it was carrying the OFFSET between each
// line's natural opening and its own band. Centre the three lines on their bands
// and the spread collapses from 3.9x to 2.0x, which is the tell.
//
// ⚠ NOT THE YEAR-1 OPENING RATIO EITHER. Three simulated years run on top of
// these, so the opening lands at roughly 1.01x / 1.55x / 1.42x premium. Anyone
// reading 0.41 as "WC opens at 0.41x premium" is wrong by a factor of two and a
// half.
//
// DISPLACED BY: nothing. A real capital standard would displace the BAND, not
// this. See the closed form recorded under the band below.

// ⚠ K COULD NOT CARRY THE FORWARD-BOOKING ARM, AND THE FIX WAS NOT K. RESOLVED

// disabled, per 995f6f9 — at 250 seeds per K, five K per line, against a THREE
// YEAR pre-game:
//

//
// The FB-off column reproduced the then-shipped 0.41 / 0.27 / 0.41 inside its
// own noise, so the method was sound and there was no drift confounding it. The
// slope was intact — K's leverage per unit barely moved — and THE INTERCEPT had
// gone. WC and GL solved NEGATIVE, and worse than negative-therefore-clamp: at
// K = 0 exactly, with no starting capital at all, WC's unfiltered median was
// 1.303 against a band ceiling of 1.22 and GL's was 1.844 against 1.80. Neither
// line could be brought INSIDE its band at any admissible K.
//
// ⚠ AND THE EARLIER READING OF THE SAME MEASUREMENT WAS SOLVED ON BOTH FLAGS ON,
// WHICH IS A STATE NOBODY RUNS. Re-measured on FB alone the wall is HIGHER, not
// lower — 1.303 against the both-flags 0.871, which today solves at K = 0.0610.
// PRICING_TRIANGLE was holding part of it up by re-pricing, so premium rose with
// the booking release and the ratio's denominator absorbed it. That is why the
// old note's conclusion has to be read as being about the flagged arm only.
//
// WHY IT WAS NEVER K'S JOB. Booking a cohort at its contracted initial estimate
// understates incurred while the book is YOUNG. A pool in runoff equilibrium
// does not have that problem — the development of its older years offsets the
// under-booking of its newest — and a three-year book is nowhere near
// equilibrium, so three years of income were overstated and the opening ran away
// with them. That is a property of the BOOK'S AGE PROFILE, and K is a scalar on
// the starting capital: it moves the slope term and cannot touch the intercept
// the age profile sets.
//
// THE FIX IS THE BOOK. See MATURATION_YEARS in priorHistoryEngine: the pre-game
// now plays seven maturation years before its three declared ones, so ten
// accident years exist at game start, and re-pins surplus at the boundary so
// what carries forward is the book rather than the profit that built it.
// Re-solved against the shipped configuration afterwards — FB on, PT off, the
// same method, 250 seeds per K and a Newton step on 800 INDEPENDENT seeds:

  //
  // ⚠ AND THE DIRECTION REVERSED ON WC AND GL, WHICH IS THE TELL THAT THIS IS A
  // DIFFERENT CAUSE FROM THE THIRD DRIFT RATHER THAN MORE OF IT. Every previous
  // re-solve pushed the pin DOWN (0.3250 -> 0.2503 on WC) because the pre-game
  // kept growing the book and the reserve with it. Freezing the pre-game roster
  // removes that growth: the opening book is now the STARTING ENROLMENT, ~60
  // members on WC against the ~120 the departure change had produced, so the
  // reserve the surplus is measured against is far smaller and the pin has to
  // rise to reach the same ratio.
  //
  // PROPERTY MOVES FOR THE OPPOSITE REASON AND THAT IS WHY IT MOVED AT ALL.
  // Its band is on PREMIUM, not reserve. A smaller book is less premium, so the
  // same pin over-delivers the ratio — it read +4.0 SE high — and the pin comes
  // DOWN. Two lines up and one down, from one change, because the two anchors
  // respond to book size in opposite directions. That is worth having written

  // otherwise look for two causes.

  //
  // ⚠ AND GL NEEDED THE POOLED SOLVE AGAIN — THE SAME TWO-SEED-BASE DISAGREEMENT
  // RECORDED ABOVE FOR WC, WITH THE LINES SWAPPED. At the solver's own 600-seed
  // answer of 0.1843 its base read 0.4925 (inside) while the gate's read 0.450,
  // and opening-centring-check FAILED it at -2.2 SE. Re-solved at 1,200 seeds on
  // each base independently:
  //
  //     gate base (OCC_)   GL -> 0.2119
  //     solver base (PIN_) GL -> 0.1935
  //
  // The two bases sit about 0.018 apart in K, which is the same order as the
  // disagreement WC showed last time. GL is therefore set on the POOLED 2,400
  // instances at 0.2027 — which both runs evaluated directly, reading 0.4855 on
  // the gate's base and 0.5216 on the solver's, pooled 0.5036 against a 0.5020
  // midpoint. Neither sample was wrong; both were small.
  //
  // WC and Property are NOT pooled, because they did not need to be: at their
  // single-base answers the gate reads -0.6 SE and +0.1 SE, comfortably inside
  // its own tolerance. Pooling a line whose bases already agree buys nothing and
  // costs an hour of solve.
  //
  // ⚠ AND THE FREEZE IS WHAT MAKES THIS THE LAST DRIFT FROM THIS CAUSE. The
  // previous three were all membership moving the denominator through the
  // pre-game. The pre-game no longer moves membership at all, so the opening is
  // now independent of every decision default and of both membership flags.
  // A future drift here means something else moved — the reserve model, the
  // payout patterns, or the starting-enrolment draw itself — and should not be
  // attributed to membership without measuring it.

  // was Deficient. See FROZEN_CAPITAL_J for the defect and the chain that caused

// The last made reserves-to-surplus WORSE (0.920 -> 1.089) while the reserve
// SHRANK, because the opening moved further than the reserve did. Both sides now
// reference premium, so the margin has left the opening path entirely.
//
// ⚠ NOT A TOLERANCE AROUND STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM, which would have been
// the obvious construction and is wrong: that constant is the pre-game's year -2
// SEED, while this band tests the opening after three years of operation. It is
// the search's starting point and this is its target; a tolerance around the
// start would reject essentially every pre-game. See the pin's own comment.
//
// ⚠ STILL PER-LINE, AND ONE SHARED BAND WAS TRIED AND REJECTED ON MEASUREMENT.
// The argument for collapsing Property's separate band is sound as far as it
// goes — its old 2.0-3.0 existed because the reserve margin is structurally
// small for a short-tail line, and on a premium basis that reasoning does
// evaporate. But the three lines do NOT currently open at the same multiple of
// premium, and their ranges barely overlap: WC [0.83, 1.22] against Property
// [1.13, 1.70]. A single band spanning the union was measured and moved the
// openings materially — WC's median +22%, Property's -18% — which is a re-tune,
// and precisely the kind of uncaused movement this change exists to stop.
//
// So: one BASIS for all three lines (premium, which is the fix), three
// TOLERANCES (which is what preserves the distribution). Collapsing to a single
// number would be a separate decision about a common capital standard, and it
// should be taken deliberately rather than smuggled in behind a basis change.
//
// CALIBRATED TO PRESERVE THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION, not to re-tune it. Each band
// is the OLD margin-basis band translated onto premium at that line's median
// margin/premium ratio:
//   WC        [1.35, 2.0] x 0.612 = [0.83, 1.22]   (a3d7760, parent's ratio)
//   GL        [1.35, 2.0] x 0.900 = [1.22, 1.80]   (re-translated — see below)
//   Property  [2.0,  3.0] x 0.567 = [1.13, 1.70]   (a3d7760, parent's ratio)
// so the accept/reject decision is the same one, taken against a stable basis.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ WHEN A BAND MAY BE RE-TRANSLATED, AND WHY THE RULE IS NARROW.
//
// Translating a band at the current margin/premium ratio is how a band gets its
// number. It is NOT a standing tie to that ratio. Re-translating every time the
// ratio moves would reinstate exactly the coupling a3d7760 removed — the opening
// tracking the reserve margin — only at commit latency instead of automatically,
// which is worse, because it looks deliberate.
//
// So the TRIGGER is an observed defect in the opening, not a stale ratio. The
// translation is only the METHOD for choosing the replacement, used in place of
// picking a number.
//
// GL MET THAT BAR. The payout patterns lengthened GL's tail, its reserve rose
// 61.6% and its required margin rose with it, while surplus — pinned to premium
// — did not move. The band's floor of 1.00 ended up BELOW the margin the line
// had to hold, so the pre-game was accepting openings GL could not capitalise:
// 28.7% of solo seeds opened below their own required margin, against 0% before.
// Re-translated to [1.22, 1.80] that closes to 0.0%, with even the 10th
// percentile at 1.29x margin.
//
// ⚠ MOST OF THAT TAIL WAS THE PIN, NOT THE BAND, and the honest attribution
// matters because it is the reason the first re-translation attempted here was
// wrong. Re-centring GL's pin alone, band untouched at [1.00, 1.49], already
// takes the below-margin rate from 28.7% to 4.0%. The old pin sat so far above
// GL's band that the band was only ever accepting the LOW-SURPLUS TAIL of the
// candidate distribution, and a low-surplus candidate is one with heavy losses,
// hence a large reserve and a large margin. The 29% was mostly that selection.
// The residual 4.0% is the real defect and is structural: the floor of 1.00 sits
// below GL's margin/premium at the upper end however the pin is placed.
//
// ⚠ SO THE TRANSLATION RATIO MUST BE MEASURED UNFILTERED. Measured on the
// band-SELECTED sample, GL's ratio read 1.119 and gave [1.51, 2.24] — 48% above
// the old band, which would have been a re-tune wearing a translation's clothes.
// Measured on the UNFILTERED candidate distribution (band disabled, attempt 0)
// it is 0.900. The unfiltered figure is the right basis because it is the only
// one that does not depend on the band being calibrated, and because it is
// stable: across a 4x range of pin values it moves less than 1%.
//
//   line       unfiltered median margin/premium at K x0.5 / x1 / x2

//   Property        0.5502 / 0.5446 / 0.5446
//
// The selected ratio has no such property — it is a function of where the band
// is, so translating at it is a fixed-point iteration against your own
// selection effect. That is the same self-reference clfTables.ts records three
// passes of, and it is avoidable here rather than merely survivable.
//
// WC AND PROPERTY WERE CHECKED AND DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE. Neither has a
// defect: no seed on either line opens below its required margin, at p10
// surplus/margin 1.46 on WC and 1.91 on Property.
//
// ⚠ AND THE APPARENT CASE FOR MOVING PROPERTY EVAPORATED ON THE UNFILTERED
// BASIS, which is worth recording because it nearly caused a second re-tune.
// Property's SELECTED margin/premium read 0.401 against the parent's 0.567 — a
// 29% move that looked like GL's case. It was almost entirely selection: the old
// pin of 0.18 sat far BELOW Property's band, so the band accepted only the
// HIGH-surplus tail, which is the low-loss, low-reserve, low-margin tail.
// Unfiltered, Property's ratio is 0.5446 and the parent's figure was 0.567.
//
// A CONSISTENT UNFILTERED DERIVATION OF ALL THREE, for whoever touches one next:
//
//   line       unfiltered ratio   band it implies    band in force
//   WC              0.5575        [0.75, 1.11]       [0.83, 1.22]   +9%
//   GL              0.9000        [1.22, 1.80]       [1.22, 1.80]    on it
//   Property        0.5446        [1.09, 1.63]       [1.13, 1.70]   +4%
//
// So GL is now derived on that basis and WC and Property are 9% and 4% above it,
// carrying a3d7760's parent-selected figures. That is a basis inconsistency and
// it is being lived with rather than hidden: 9% and 4% do not warrant re-rolling
// every seed on two lines that are not misbehaving, and the numbers are written
// down so the next change starts from the right basis instead of rediscovering
// this the hard way, as this commit did.
//
// ⚠ ONE LIVE QUESTION LEFT, AND IT IS NOT AN ARITHMETIC ONE: Property opens at
// 2.76x its required margin, so its capital constraint may never bind and the
// line may carry no capital DECISION for the player. That is a game-design
// finding for the playtest, to be settled by watching someone play.
// ============================================================================
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ RE-ANCHORED TO RESERVES ON WC AND GL. PROPERTY STAYS ON PREMIUM, AND THAT
// SPLIT IS THE DECISION — NOT AN EXEMPTION.
//
// Premium is an annual FLOW; the liability is a multi-year STOCK. Capital
// adequacy for a long-tail line is judged against reserves, and this band never
// made that comparison. What it produced instead — measured on ACCEPTED
// openings with the band in force, which is what the pool actually opens with,
// 40 games, both flags on:
//
//   line       surplus/reserve   reserve/surplus   opening surplus
//   WC              0.466             2.14            $9.25M

//   Property        1.455             0.69           $18.62M
//
// A 2.38x spread between WC and GL in capital held per dollar of liability,
// from a band that was never asked the question. THAT is the defect this fixes,
// more than the level is. After: 0.330 / 0.498, a 1.51x spread, which is the
// intended J ratio of 1.52x and nothing else.
//
// ⚠ THE UNFILTERED FIGURES ARE DIFFERENT AND BOTH ARE REAL — 0.293 / 0.988 /
// 1.872, a 3.37x WC-to-GL spread. Unfiltered is the right basis for CENTRING the
// pin (see STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM) because the accepted sample is truncated
// by the band being centred. Accepted is the right basis for saying what the
// pool HOLDS. Quote whichever answers the question and say which it is.
//
// ⚠ THE TARGETS ARE THE MODEL'S OWN, NOT A RULE OF THUMB. A uniform "30% of
// reserves" was proposed and is wrong here: reserveRiskMarginNeeded/reserve is
// a STATIC per-line constant in this engine (see FROZEN_CAPITAL_J below) at
// 0.3294 / 0.5020 / 0.5923, so a flat 30% would leave every line BELOW its own
// required margin — WC by 8.9%, GL by 40.2%, Property by 49.3%. The band is set
// AT each line's own margin instead. The residual WC-to-GL spread after the
// re-anchor is 1.52x, which is exactly 0.5020/0.3294 — the intended difference
// between the lines' CLFs, not an arbitrary one.
//
// ⚠ WHY PROPERTY IS NOT ON THIS STANDARD. Property is short-tail: its reserve is
// 1.04x annual ultimate against WC's 2.96x, and it settles by age 7. Its
// surplus/reserve reads high because the DENOMINATOR is small, not because it is
// over-capitalised. Its risk is a current-year catastrophe, not runoff
// deterioration, and a short-tail cat-exposed line is capitalised against
// OCCURRENCE. Measured confirmation that the standard does not fit it: at a pin
// of ZERO — no starting capital at all — Property's pre-game still accumulates
// to surplus/reserve 0.846, above both 0.30 and its own 0.5923. No pin reaches
// the target. That floor is a sign the standard is wrong for the line, not that
// the line is wrong, and "a standard one of three lines cannot meet is not a
// standard" is answered by its not being that line's standard.
//
// ⚠ THE PRIOR REJECTION AT LINE ~1500 DOES NOT BIND THIS, AND THE NEXT READER
// SHOULD NOT HAVE TO REDISCOVER WHY. That record rejects anchoring surplus to
// the year -2 SEED draw — a static dollar band with Pearson r against seed
// premium of -0.014 / +0.068 / -0.008, and 3.6x / 16.9x / 14.8x smaller than the
// opening reserve. Its own words: the seed "is not the pool's liability in any
// case." This anchors to the OPENING reserve, which is that liability. Different
// proposal, and the measurement that killed the old one does not touch it.
//
// ⚠ THE ACCEPTANCE SEARCH IS NOT CIRCULAR, WHICH WAS THE OTHER FEAR. The test
// reads endingSurplus and endingNetReserve — BOTH OUTPUTS OF THE SAME CANDIDATE
// DRAW. It is rejection sampling, not a quantity that must be known before the
// thing producing it, so it needs none of the "agree in advance" treatment the
// aggregate's attachment needed. The reserve does move a little with the pin
// (3.6% WC, 5.2% GL across a 0.30-1.00 pin range), which makes the pin solve a
// fixed point; bisecting on median(surplus/reserve) converged in 6 passes.
//
// COST, MEASURED BY pregame-acceptance-check AT THE SHIPPED PIN, 150 seeds:

//
// No fallbacks on any line, against a 500 cap. The search survives.
//
// ⚠ READ THOSE NET OF PROPERTY. Property's pin and band are UNTOUCHED and its
// per-line search is independent of the other two, so its 3.27 -> 3.95 is pure
// run-to-run and context drift — about +21%. Netting it off, the re-anchor costs
// roughly +30% on WC and +59% on GL, not the +58% and +92% the raw figures
// suggest.
//
// ⚠ AND ON THE SHIPPED ARM WC GOT CHEAPER, NOT DEARER. Measured with the band in
// force under both flags on, WC's accepted search went 4.80 -> 2.92 attempts:
// the parent pin was calibrated against PRICING_TRIANGLE OFF, so under the arm
// that now ships it was already off-centre. Pool-mean attempts across the three
// lines are 3.22 -> 3.38, essentially flat. The 2.23 baseline above is the
// parent's own published figure and is kept because it is what the record said;
// it is not measured on the arm this commit ships.
//
// ⚠ AND PROPERTY WAS THE CONTROL THAT MADE THOSE TWO NUMBERS TRUSTWORTHY —

  // than about a quantity that happens to differ by line.
  //
  // ⚠ THIS REPLACES b9d797e's 1.5x PREMIUM, WHICH WAS EVEN IN THE WRONG UNIT.
  // Premium is a flow and the liability is a stock, and premium/reserve differs
  // by line, so an even premium multiple left the lines at 1.44x / 2.15x / 2.85x
  // of what they each need. Measured, b9d797e's opening:

  //     line        required   surplus   multiple   x premium
  //     WC           $10.1M    $14.6M     1.44x       1.48

  //
  // 2.28x IS THE POOL'S OWN CURRENT MULTIPLE, chosen so this REDISTRIBUTES
  // capital rather than cutting it: the pool total is unchanged at $85.2M, WC
  // rises 58%, GL 6%, and Property falls 20%. A level was not invented; the
  // pool's existing total was held and the unevenness taken out of it.
  //
  // ⚠ AND THE UNEVENNESS WAS NOT WHERE IT LOOKED. Before the catastrophe term
  // Property read 3.72x and looked like the over-padded line. Most of that was
  // the MEASURE: its retained catastrophe was missing from the denominator. With
  // it in, Property is 2.85x and WC at 1.44x is the thin one. The fix moves
  // capital TO WC, not away from GL.
  //
  // ⚠ HALF-WIDTHS UNCHANGED — WC +/-19.03%, GL +/-19.20%, Property +/-20.14%,
  // each the relative half-width it already had, so only the centre moves and
  // this stays a translation. The pin moved with it; see
  // STARTING_CAPITAL_TO_PREMIUM, and the -84%-of-band-width failure recorded
  // there for what moving one alone does.
  //
  // ⚠ CALIBRATED ON FULL REINSURANCE, WHICH NEEDED NO CHANGE. The pre-game runs
  // defaultDecisionSet, which places every purchasable occurrence layer and sets
  // aggregateStopLevel -1, so the opening already assumes the most cover on every
  // line with WC's aggregate excluded. With the tower placed the catastrophe term
  // is just the retention, which is what makes these multiples comparable.
  //

  // its required capital — with WC at 1.00x and GL at 1.03x, which is the J90

// J — CAPITAL HELD PER DOLLAR OF RESERVE, FROZEN AS LITERALS AT CALIBRATION.
//
// ⚠ FROZEN DELIBERATELY, AND THE BLOCK BELOW SAYS WHY IN ITS OWN WORDS.
// J_line = T x (reserveMarginCLF_line - 1) EXACTLY, so a reserve pin carrying a
// capital rationale puts the 90% CLF back on the opening path — the single
// coupling a3d7760 removed. Freezing the CLF-derived value as a literal is that
// block's own prescribed remedy: the CLF sets the number once, here, and never
// becomes a live consumer. DO NOT replace these with a call to the CLF table.
//
// These are reserveRiskMarginNeeded/reserve, measured with ZERO dispersion
// across seeds and across both payout-pattern arms.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ A CLF CHANGE MOVES BOTH ENDS OF THIS CHAIN, AND ONLY ONE END WAS FOLLOWED.
// THAT IS THE DEFECT THIS RECORDS, AND IT IS WORTH MORE THAN THE NUMBER.
//
// The 90% stop feeds TWO things that must agree:
//
//   reserveRiskMarginNeeded  = reserve x (clf90 - 1)      <- what a line MUST hold
//   OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND.WC  = J x (1 +/- 19.03%)         <- what it OPENS with
//
// and J is clf90 - 1, the same quantity. Move the table and both ends move —
// one automatically, because the engine reads the table live, and one only if
// somebody edits this literal. The freeze is what makes the second end MANUAL;
// it is the price of the freeze and it was not paid.
//
// When WC took its supplied curve at ed8b582 the chain was traced in ONE
// direction only. The satisfaction limb was followed — the rise moved the
// surplus band ladder, surplusComfortable was re-solved onto the new boundary
// and surplusWeight with it (see memberSatisfaction's "SECOND, 0.0469 ->
// 0.0344, when WC took a supplied CLF curve"). The opening end of the same
// chain was not looked at. A future CLF change must walk BOTH; there is no
// gate that walks it for you, because the freeze is deliberately invisible to
// the engine.
//
// ⚠ AND IT WAS THREE TABLE CHANGES, NOT ONE. Quoting only the supplied curve
// overstates the step and understates how long this had been wrong. WC's 90%
// stop, by commit:
//
//     eaf930a  2026-09-10  1.3294   J 0.3294   <- the band was calibrated HERE
//     241ebc8^             1.2776   J 0.2776   (-15.7% on J)
//     241ebc8  2026-09-17  1.3120   J 0.3120   (+12.4%)  re-derived at the small band
//     ed8b582  2026-09-18  1.4730   J 0.4730   (+51.6%)  supplied curve
//
// The supplied curve is the dominant step and the brief's figures for it are
// exact — +12.27% on the stop, +51.60% on the margin. But the band is anchored
// to the FREEZE value, so the drift it actually carried is 1.3294 -> 1.4730,
// +10.80% on the stop and +43.60% on J. Two of the three steps partly
// cancelled. Quote the freeze-to-live figure when talking about the band and
// the step figure when talking about the curve, and say which.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE TRIGGER WAS AN OBSERVED DEFECT IN THE OPENING, WHICH IS THE ONLY THING
// THAT LICENSES A RE-TRANSLATION — see the rule beside OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND.
// Measured, 100 seeds, WC solo, BEFORE:
//
//     WC opened at 0.570 .. 0.827 of its own required margin
//     Deficient on 100 of 100 seeds; 0 opened Adequate or better
//
// ⚠ AND THAT IS ARITHMETIC, NOT SAMPLING. margin/reserve IS J exactly, so the
// band in surplus/margin units is just band/J: [0.2667, 0.3921] / 0.4730 =
// [0.5638, 0.8290]. The CEILING of the accepted window sat at 0.829, below even
// the Thin floor of 0.90. Every opening the pre-game could ACCEPT was Deficient
// by construction. The measured max of 0.827 is that ceiling, not a tail.
//
// ⚠ SO THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF GL'S CASE, AND THE PRECEDENT'S OWN WARNING DOES
// NOT APPLY HERE. GL's block records that MOST OF ITS TAIL WAS THE PIN, NOT THE
// BAND — re-centring the pin alone took 28.7% below-margin to 4.0%, because the
// pin sat outside the band and the band was only ever selecting a low-surplus
// tail. That check was run here and comes back the other way: no pin placement
// can help, because the band's whole window is inside Deficient and the pin only
// chooses WHERE IN the window the mass sits. WC's defect is entirely structural.
//
// ⚠ BUT THE PIN STILL HAD TO MOVE WITH THE BAND, FOR THE OTHER REASON. The pin
// is solved so the UNFILTERED candidate median lands on the band's midpoint. At
// the old band that held — opening-centring-check read WC -0.7 SE. Re-centring
// the band on 0.4730 without touching the pin would leave the unfiltered median
// at 0.322 against a floor of 0.3830: outside the band entirely, -84% of band
// width against a 25% tolerance, and acceptance off the cliff that gate's header
// describes. Moving a band and leaving the pin is not a smaller change than
// moving both; it is a different and worse one.

// It fixes the capital STRUCTURE. It does not, on its own, make a bad year hurt.
//
//   investment income as a share of surplus   = (1 + k) x 5.42%
//   a one-SD reserve deviation                =       k x 4.13%
//
// with k = reserve/surplus. Since 5.42 > 4.13 the income term beats a one-sigma
// bad year at EVERY capital structure — there is no leverage at which an
// ordinary bad year is a loss. At the new targets the reserve volatility that
// would change that is 7.20% on WC and 8.14% on GL, against a measured 4.13%.
// So difficulty is a question about the SIZE OF THE SHOCK, and the shock is
// small because the development law is mean-one around a systematic ~30% that
// premium already funds. Re-anchoring the band is not an answer to it.
// ============================================================================

// ============================================================================
// THE ARITHMETIC BEHIND ANY FUTURE CAPITAL RULE — recorded because it is not
// obvious, and because it is the thing to check before proposing one.
//
// A capital standard would replace the band above with a rule of the form
// "hold J x reserve" or "hold T x required margin". The two are the same rule,
// because required margin is EXACTLY a per-line multiple of the reserve:
//
//   reserveRiskMarginNeeded = expectedNetUnpaidLoss x (reserveMarginCLF - 1)
//
// and reserveMarginCLF at the 90% stop is a STATIC per-line table. So
// margin/reserve is not an estimate with a confidence interval, it is a
// constant, and it measures with zero dispersion across seeds and across both
// payout-pattern arms:
//
//   WC 0.3294      GL 0.5020      Property 0.5923
//
// Therefore J_line = T x (CLF_line - 1) exactly. Which means: any per-line
// reserve pin that carries a capital RATIONALE puts the 90% CLF back on the
// opening path — the single coupling a3d7760 removed, and the one
// simulationEngine.ts's margin site says in terms to keep out. A uniform J
// avoids the CLF but then asserts the three lines should hold the same capital
// per dollar of reserve while their CLFs differ by 1.80x, which is not a
// standard either. If a standard is adopted, freeze the CLF-derived J as
// literal constants at calibration time — the way a3d7760 froze this band — so
// the CLF sets the number once and never becomes a live consumer.
//
// ⚠ A RESERVE PIN WAS PROPOSED AND MEASURED AND REJECTED. Not on taste: the
// proposal was to seed surplus as J x reserve instead of K x premium, and the
// only reserve in existence at year -2 is the bootstrap draw, which is a STATIC
// DOLLAR BAND (WC $4-8M, GL $1-2.5M, Property $0.3-0.9M) with no link to how big
// the pool is. Pearson r against seed premium over 200 instances:
//
//   WC -0.014      GL +0.068      Property -0.008
//
// and seed reserve/premium spans 1.94x / 2.71x / 4.17x p90-over-p10. J x seed
// reserve would make opening capital INDEPENDENT OF POOL SIZE and 2-4x noisier
// than K x premium. The seed reserve is also 3.6x / 16.9x / 14.8x smaller than
// the reserve at the opening, so it is not the pool's liability in any case.
// Whoever proposes this next should find this measurement rather than repeat the
// proposal.
//
// ⚠ AND THIS DOES NOT REJECT ANCHORING TO THE OPENING RESERVE, WHICH IS WHAT
// SHIPPED. Read the paragraph above carefully: every objection in it is about
// the year -2 SEED draw. Uncorrelated with pool size, 2-4x noisier than K x
// premium, and — in its own words — "not the pool's liability in any case."
// The OPENING reserve, at the end of the pre-game, is 3.6x / 16.9x / 14.8x
// larger and IS that liability; it is an output of the same candidate draw the
// acceptance test already reads, so it is neither noisy in the seed's way nor
// circular. OPENING_SURPLUS_BAND is now anchored to it on WC and GL. The
// measurement above stands and still forbids the seed version; it does not
// reach this one.

//
// ⚠ CORRECTED ONTO A NO-LATE-REPORTING BASIS BEFORE FITTING, and that correction
// is the single largest thing separating these numbers from the previous ones.
// The source measures closed over the count REPORTED SO FAR, and that count
// keeps growing — claims are still being reported at age 5. The model has no
// report lag at all: every claim exists at age 0 and the count is final from the
// start. So the source's raw share is closed over a denominator that is still
// filling, and applying it to a full denominator closes too many claims too
// early.
//
// Each source age's closed share is therefore divided by that age's reported
// development factor before fitting. The reported count grows 12.16% from age 1
// to ultimate, so age 1 carries a factor of 0.8916 and the correction decays at
// 0.4421 per step — two numbers that reproduce the whole adjustment, recorded
// here for the same reason k and b are, and with no counts.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS A CALIBRATION, NOT A MECHANIC. The alternative was to give the model
// late reporting — a status layer, or a real report lag — and it was rejected:
// adding a mechanic to fix a calibration is backwards, and the honest statement
// is that this model has no late reporting and its closure curve is calibrated
// to that. FOURTH SIGHTING of the removed report lag (a stale WC header,
// understated workbook counts, the closure discrepancy, now this basis); if
// there is a fifth, the assumption deserves one commit that states everywhere it
// is load-bearing.
//
// ⚠⚠ THERE WAS A FIFTH AND A SIXTH, THE MECHANIC IS NOW BEING BUILT, AND THIS
// CORRECTION IS ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH IT. LINE_REPORTING_PATTERN below
// reintroduces exactly the late reporting these curves were corrected for, and
// the 0.8916 above IS reportedShareAtAge(line, 1) there — the same quantity,
// derived twice from the same 12.16%. Wire the pattern into the engine without
// undoing this correction and the adjustment lands twice: these curves already
// assume a full denominator, and late reporting makes the denominator fill
// again. NOT FIXED YET, deliberately — the pattern is read by nothing. Whoever
// wires it up re-fits these curves on the raw basis or removes the correction,
// and needs BOTH constants: 0.8916 at age 1, decaying at 0.4421 per step.
//
// ⚠ CLOSURE IS SLOWER THAN PAYMENT AND THE TWO ARE SEPARATE FITS. Compare the
// k's against FITTED_PAYOUT_PATTERN's — WC closure 0.670 against payout 0.64, GL
// closure 1.410 against payout 1.88. Genuinely different, not one number wearing
// two names.
//
// ⚠ FITTED ON A GAME-RANGE OBJECTIVE: ages 1-5 carry full weight, ages beyond
// carry a fifth. The game is five years, so ages 1-5 are what a player ever sees
// and ages 8-10 are almost never reached; the tail is kept at a fifth rather than
// dropped so the curve still has to terminate sensibly instead of running off.
//
// ⚠ AND THE OBVIOUS WEIGHTINGS WERE MEASURED AND REJECTED, which is worth
// recording because they LOOK like they serve the same purpose and do not. The
// age-1 residual is the visible symptom, so weighting toward age 1 is the
// tempting fix: 1/age cuts WC's age-1 residual from +3.42 to +1.49, and an
// age-1 x8 weight to +0.64. But measured over ages 1-5 TOGETHER — the actual
// stated goal — both make things WORSE on every line:
//
//   line       objective     age-1 resid   RMSE ages 1-5
//   WC         unweighted       +3.42         0.0306
//   WC         1/age            +1.49         0.0319
//   WC         age-1 x8         +0.64         0.0338
//   WC         game range       +3.02         0.0303
//   GL         unweighted       +2.33         0.0213
//   GL         game range       +2.18         0.0213
//   Property   unweighted       -0.78         0.0119
//   Property   game range       -0.75         0.0119
//
// So age-1 x8 overfits the front harder than 1/age, and 1/age overfits it too:
// both buy the single age-1 point by giving away ages 2-5. On the ALL-CLAIMS
// curves the game-range objective is therefore nearly the unweighted fit — those
// series barely reach past the game anyway. Where it earns its place is the
// LARGE-claim curves below, which run to ages 10 and 23.
//
// THE AGE-1 RESIDUAL SURVIVES, at +3.02 on WC and +2.18 on GL. It is the
// Weibull's inability to reproduce a fast-then-crawl shape, not a calibration
// error, and no objective tested removes it without costing more elsewhere.

// first year's cohort closed at age 1 and 2.5% by age 3, against 49/72/77 for all
// claims. GL's own over-$100k experience is the same shape: 0.8% at age 1 and
// 15.8% at age 3 against 27/61/79 for all claims. A size-blind rule holds trivial
// files open for years and lets large ones close early, and both are wrong.
//
// Each line's all-claims curve is therefore a MIXTURE of a large-claim curve and
// a small-claim one. The large curve is fitted directly against that line's own
// over-threshold experience, on the same no-late-reporting basis and the same
// game-range objective as the curves above; the weight is MEASURED on the model's
// own drawn claims; the small curve is then backed out of that line's own
// all-claims curve at that weight.
//
// ⚠ THE EARLIER CONCLUSION "WC's LARGE CURVE DOES NOT TRANSPLANT" WAS MEASURED
// CORRECTLY AND READ TOO BROADLY. It ruled out putting WC's large curve inside
// GL's mixture, which was right — WC's reaches 43% by age 10 and cannot sit
// inside a GL all-claims curve that reaches 100%. It was then taken to mean GL
// and Property could have no size split at all, and that did not follow. GL's OWN
// large curve reaches 99.7% by age 10 and sits inside its own curve without
// strain. The cost of the over-reading was a $4M GL claim closing on GL's
// all-claims curve at 76.7% by age 3 when its own experience says 17%.
//
// ⚠ THE RECONCILIATION TEST IS AGAINST EACH LINE'S OWN ALL-CLAIMS CURVE, not
// against the source data, and the distinction matters. Both the mixture and the
// plain curve carry the same shape residual against the data, so comparing to the
// data makes an honest split look broken — WC reads 0.041 that way, which is the
// Weibull's age-2 problem, not the split's. Comparing to the CURVE isolates the
// only question that matters: does splitting by size change the line's aggregate
// closure? Measured:
//
//   WC   maxAbsErr 0.0064      GL   maxAbsErr 0.0087
//   GL with WC's large curve transplanted:  0.0442
//
// The test still separates a real split from the transplant by a factor of five.
//
// ⚠ PROPERTY IS DELIBERATELY NOT SPLIT, AND THE REASON IS ITS THRESHOLD RATHER
// THAN MISSING DATA. Property's source split is at $25k, not $100k, and on the
// model's own severity distribution that is the 23rd PERCENTILE: 76.80% of drawn
// Property claims exceed it, against 4.63% of WC's and 8.21% of GL's over $100k.
// A "large claim" band containing three quarters of the book is not the same kind
// of cut as one containing five percent, and a mixture at p = 0.768 is dominated
// by its large component — the all-claims curve already IS approximately the
// large curve, so the split would buy almost nothing even with the extract in
// hand.
//
// That gap between what $25k means on the source and what it means here is
// unresolved and is the real finding: either Property's modelled severity is
// scaled differently from the book the threshold came from (model median claim
// $65.4k), or $25k is a handling threshold rather than a size band. Fitting a
// split across that gap would be inventing a reconciliation. Property stays
// size-blind until the question is settled.
//
// ⚠ AND THE THRESHOLDS DIFFERING BY LINE IS ITSELF THE ARGUMENT FOR A CONTINUOUS
// SIZE FUNCTION. $100k sits at WC's 95th percentile, GL's 92nd, and Property's
// 8th. Three lines, three unrelated places in their own distributions, each a
// nominal dollar boundary that erodes as severity trends — the fourth instance of
// that trap on this branch. A function of size relative to the line's own scale
// has none of these problems. Not resolved here: closure is still display-only,
// so no boundary moves anything yet.
//
// DISPLACED BY: a continuous size function, and Property's own extract if the
// threshold question is ever settled.

// THE REPORTING PATTERN — LATE REPORTING, STEP 2 OF 5. READ BY NOTHING.
//
// ⚠ WIRED TO NOTHING AND FLAG-GATED OFF. This commit ships a curve, a judgement
// and a deriver. No engine value moves; no claim carries a reportedYear; no
// cohort books on a reported subset. Those are steps 3 and 4. If you are here
// because something reads LINE_REPORTING_PATTERN, that is new.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHY IT EXISTS — THE SIXTH SIGHTING, NOW WITH A MEASURED CONSEQUENCE.
//
// The model has no late reporting: every claim is in the register from its
// accident year and the count never moves. That absence has been rediscovered
// six times (a stale WC header, understated workbook counts, the closure
// discrepancy, the closure-curve basis correction, the report-lag deletion note
// below at `reportLag IS GONE`, and now this). What is new is that it is no
// longer only an absence — it is the named cause of a measured gap:
//
//   the printed triangle: the claim REGISTER MOVED 0 TIMES across every
//   valuation of every accident year on both arms, and GL's AY3 runs from
//   $10.2M to $27.0M on the same 397 claims. Every age-to-age factor the model
//   produces is severity on files already open.
//
//   the pool's own book develops 3.91x cumulative against the model's 2.63x,
//   and the gap concentrates in the first step: 1.872 against 1.448.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE THREE FIGURES ARE THE WHOLE EVIDENCE BASE, AND THEY ARE COUNT FIGURES.
//
//   reported counts grow  6.5%  by age 2
//   reported counts grow 12.16% from age 1 to ultimate
//   reported counts still moving 0.25% at age 5
//
// The curve below has exactly three free parameters and is solved EXACTLY
// against those three — there is no fitting freedom left, which is the point.
// A two-parameter family cannot do it: a Weibull matched on ages 1 and 2 lands
// at 0.61% at age 5 and a single geometric at 0.59%, against a recorded 0.25%.
// Reporting completes FASTER than either, and that is a property of the source
// figures rather than a modelling choice. report-lag-derive.ts re-solves the
// three constants and FAILS if they stop reproducing their own targets.
//
// ⚠ POOL-LEVEL, NOT PER LINE. The three figures come from one extract across
// the whole book. This is keyed by line so a future per-line fit has somewhere
// to land; today all three lines carry identical numbers. Do not read the
// keying as evidence of a per-line split. There is none.
//
// ⚠ AND THE THIRD FIGURE HAS THREE READINGS. "Still moving 0.25% at age 5" is
// taken as a GROWTH RATE, R(5)/R(4) - 1, because that is how the 6.5% is
// stated. As an increment of ultimate count it gives laterStepDecay 0.258475,
// within 0.2%. As the share STILL UNREPORTED at age 5 it gives 0.367271 — 42%
// higher and a materially fatter tail. Named, not resolved; no further evidence

// THE SEVERITY TILT — AND WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT BUY.
//
// Lag is drawn CONDITIONAL ON SEVERITY, which is the causal direction: a claim
// reports late because nobody knew it was a claim — a latent injury, an
// occupational disease, an abuse allegation, a construction defect. Severity
// does not follow from lateness; both follow from the claim being the kind of
// thing that takes years to surface.
//
//     odds(late | s) = w . F(s)^BETA,   P = odds / (1 + odds)
//
// F(s) is the claim's QUANTILE in its own line's severity distribution; w is
// solved per line so the expected late COUNT share equals unreportedAtAge1.
//
// ⚠ THE TILT IS ON RANK, NOT SIZE, AND THE SIZE VERSION WAS MEASURED AND
// REJECTED. `odds ∝ (s/s_median)^BETA` is the obvious form and it is unusable
// on these distributions: GL is Pareto with alpha 1.3, so s/median runs to five
// figures in the tail and odds proportional to it make every large claim late
// with certainty. At BETA = 1 it returns E[s|late]/E[s|timely] of 49.1x on GL
// and 30.7x on WC with 86% of dollars in late claims — not a late-reporting
// assumption, a restatement of the tail. F(s) is uniform whatever the tail
// does. Do not "simplify" this back to the size form; the deriver prints both.
//
// ⚠ THE MULTIPLIER IS AN OUTPUT, BUT THE JUDGEMENT IS NOT REMOVED — IT IS
// RELOCATED, AND THAT IS WORTH STATING PLAINLY. There is exactly ONE degree of
// freedom the recorded data does not pin, and BETA, the multiplier, the late
// value share and an odds ratio between size bands are all different coordinates
// on that same number. All three recorded figures are COUNT figures; they carry
// no severity information and no care with them will produce any.
//
// What the causal form does buy: the SHAPE of how the judgement distributes
// across claims is defensible, the multiplier VARIES BY LINE off each line's own
// severity mix rather than being imposed uniformly, and BETA = 1 has a natural
// reading on a rank scale — the odds of reporting late scale linearly with where
// the claim sits in its own size distribution — where no multiplier has a
// natural default. BETA is a judgement of exactly the same standing as
// CLAIM_REVISION_PHI, IBNER_TOTAL_SD and the drift constants.
//
// ⚠ LAG LENGTH IS NOT ALSO TILTED, deliberately and conservatively. Causally it
// should be (a latent claim is both bigger and slower), but the count curve is
// already pinned, so a second severity channel would add a parameter without
// adding evidence. Leaving it out UNDERSTATES the multiplier.
//
// WHAT IT COMES OUT AT, derived over each line's own drawn population,
// 40 accident years, at the shipped BETA = 1.0:
//
//   line       E[s|late]/E[s|timely]   late VALUE share   emergence at age 2
//   WC                  2.003                19.58%            1.1280
//   GL                  2.011                19.65%            1.1276
//   Property            1.902                18.79%            1.1211
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠ AND THE VERDICT IT IMPLIES ON THE MODEL'S SEVERITY DEVELOPMENT. RECORD THE
// RANGE, NOT THE PICK. GL's age 1->2 factor is 1.448 in the model and PURE
// severity; the pool's 1.872 is severity x emergence. Crediting the emergence
// this pattern supplies leaves:
//
//   BETA   emergence at age 2   severity required   the model's 1.448 is...
//   0.00          1.0650              1.7577              17.6% short
//   0.50          1.0959              1.7081              15.2% short
//   1.00          1.1276              1.6602              12.8% short   <-- SHIPPED
//   2.00          1.1926              1.5697               7.8% short
//   4.00          1.3303              1.4072               2.9% over
//
// So on the shipped judgement, late reporting accounts for rather less than half
// the first-step gap and the model's severity development is still about an
// eighth short. NOTHING HERE WAS SIZED TO CLOSE THAT GAP — BETA was chosen a
// priori and the column is reported, not aimed at. At no BETA in the sweep does
// emergence alone account for it.
//

// ⚠⚠ THE CLOSURE CURVES ALREADY CARRY A CORRECTION FOR THE THING THIS PATTERN
// REINTRODUCES, AND WIRING THIS UP WITHOUT UNDOING IT DOUBLE-COUNTS.
//
// CLOSURE_BY_SIZE and FITTED_CLOSURE_CURVE above were fitted on a NO-LATE-
// REPORTING BASIS ON PURPOSE. The source measures closed over the count
// REPORTED SO FAR, which is still filling; each source age's closed share was
// therefore DIVIDED by that age's reported development factor before fitting.
// The two constants that reproduce the whole adjustment are recorded at that
// block: AGE 1 CARRIES 0.8916 AND THE CORRECTION DECAYS AT 0.4421 PER STEP.
//
// 0.8916 is exactly reportedShareAtAge(line, 1) above — the same quantity,
// derived twice from the same 12.16%. So the closure curves are already stated
// on a full-denominator basis. Give the model late reporting and the
// denominator starts filling again, and that correction is applied twice.
//
// NOT FIXED HERE, deliberately: this commit moves no engine value. Step 5 of the

// The z_t term has zero mean, so the STOCHASTIC component is a pure martingale:
// no mean reversion, and a player cannot infer from a cohort's history where it
// is heading. The b/H term is a deterministic unwind of the initial optimistic
// booking, present so E[estimate(H)] = registerSum EXACTLY, per cohort — the
// pool cannot end up paying less than it drew. A player who works out that
// drift from their own funding choice is reading their own decision back, which
// is the intended lesson rather than a leak.
//
// ⚠ DEVELOPMENT IS ENTIRELY RETAINED. The tower cedes PER CLAIM and no claim
// changed size; this is an aggregate overlay on top of a register the tower has
// already run against. So reinsuranceRecovery is unmoved and 100% of

// TWO SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED. WC's 25% and GL's 20% are judgement calls about
// what a long-tail casualty runoff looks like. Property's ORIGINAL 8% was the
// same kind of call and was defensible on its own terms — a short-tail line
// genuinely does settle fast. It was raised to 15% for a different reason: at
// 8% the per-accident-year exhibit had almost nothing to show. Measured over
// 200 games, only 27.0% of Property rows ever moved more than 1%, none were
// still developing by game year 5, and a ten-year exhibit rendered as columns
// of repeated identical numbers for every accident year older than about
// three. 15% is chosen so the display has content. Both numbers are honest;
// they are answering different questions, and this note exists so a later
// reader does not mistake the second for the first.
//
// THE HORIZON DELIBERATELY DID NOT MOVE. Lengthening it would make each step
// QUIETER (the step is total/sqrt(E[H])), which is the opposite of what the
// exhibit needed — a longer runoff spreads the same total over more years and
// shows less per year, not more.
//
// AND THERE IS A REAL ARGUMENT FOR THE HIGHER NUMBER, worth stating so it does
// not read as pure display tuning. Property's book carries claims to $75M, and
// a large fire or flood genuinely takes years to adjust — scope disputes,
// business-interruption measurement, subrogation. A property book whose
// ultimates never move more than 8% is a book without large losses in it.

//     z_c = sqrt(rho) . Z_{line,year}  +  sqrt(1 - rho) . z_c^idio
//
// The mechanism, and the reason this form and no other, is at
// calendarBlendedZ in simulationEngine.ts. The short version: the blend leaves
// EVERY COHORT'S MARGINAL LAW UNCHANGED at any rho, so E[factor] = 1 exactly,
// the reserve martingale is untouched, per-cohort dispersion is untouched, and
// cohort-ledger-check's three identities still hold by construction. Only the
// joint law moves. Nothing below is a free choice about a marginal.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS IS FOR. The reserve-driven residual — netIncurredLoss minus
// netUltimateLoss, the engine's own identity — was adverse in 100% of
// pool-years at a mean of ~30% of the opening reserve, and that mean is NOT
// risk: it is forward booking working as designed and the premium funds it.
// Only the DEVIATION is risk, and it was far too small for a bad year to cost
// the pool more than a year's investment income. The thresholds at which it
// does, computed at the post-re-anchor capital structure, are WC 7.21%,
// GL 8.12%, pool 9.06% of the opening reserve.
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠ WC WAS THE WHOLE PROBLEM AND GL WAS NEVER ONE. Measured at 150 games x 10
// played years on THREE INDEPENDENT SEED SETS, residual SD, null arm:
//
//   line       three seed sets        mean    threshold
//   WC         3.14 / 2.95 / 2.86     2.98      7.21     a factor of 2.4 short
//   GL         7.85 / 9.04 / 8.06     8.32      8.12     ALREADY THERE
//   Property   8.61 / 8.58 / 8.40     8.53        -
//   POOL       3.96 / 4.23 / 4.11     4.10      9.06     see the shock-event note
//
// GL's own estimate swings +/-0.6pp between seed sets, and on one fixed seed
// scheme it reads 7.20pp at 30 games against 7.73pp at 150 — climbing with
// sample size, which is the heavy-tail signature reserveStepSigma's header
// warns about from the other direction: the sample variance of this thing
// approaches the truth from BELOW, so a small run understates it and a bar set
// on a small run is set too low. So GL's scale stays at 1.00 and that is a FINDING, not an
// omission: any GL multiplier solved against an 8.12 target would be fitting a
// number whose measurement error is larger than the adjustment.
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠ THE THREE MECHANISMS THAT WERE REJECTED, AND THE FIRST WILL BE REACHED FOR
// AGAIN. Anyone wanting more reserve dispersion will reach for phi first. Do
// not. All figures 30 games x 10 years, pool residual mean and SD:
//
//   arm          mean      SD          verdict
//   base        29.90%    3.91pp
//   IBNER x0    29.78%    3.30pp       the cohort lognormal off entirely
//   IBNER x2    29.92%    4.47pp       mean holds
//   IBNER x4    30.25%    6.03pp       mean holds
//   phi   x2    27.86%    4.45pp       MEAN MOVES -2.04pp
//   phi   x4    28.15%   62.28pp       not a measurement of anything
//
// 1. NOT phi — AND THE REASON IS THE MEAN, NOT THE REACH. The per-claim law
//    DOES reach the cohort reserve and in fact dominates it: with the cohort
//    lognormal off entirely the pool SD only falls 3.91 -> 3.30pp, so the
//    per-claim law owns 3.30 of the 3.91 and the lognormal owns 2.10 in
//    quadrature. On the shipped path a cohort's whole stochastic movement IS
//    the sum of per-claim revisions — `newUnpaid += res.retained` in
//    processIbner. What looks like a cohort-level law from a distance is the
//    DETERMINISTIC forward-booking drift, which is applied per claim inside
//    the same call and is not the dispersion path at all.
//
//    phi is rejected because widening it moves the level, through TWO
//    DIFFERENT MECHANISMS on two different lines. Gross against net, same
//    sample:
//
//      WC        base net 24.52 / gross 28.48  ->  phi x2 net 22.98 / gross 28.70
//      Property  base net 17.88 / gross 22.03  ->  phi x2 net 14.92 / gross 19.86
//
//    WC's gross mean is FLAT and its whole loss is CESSION CONVEXITY: the
//    retained function is concave in occurrence size, so a wider mean-one draw
//    on the gross claim is not mean-one on the pool's retained share.
//    Property's gross mean falls on its own, before any cession — the claim
//    floor in cedeDevelopment and the settlement and close clips. Both widen
//    with the draw, so NO phi widens without moving the level.
//
// 2. NOT A WIDER INDEPENDENT DRAW ON ITS OWN. IBNER x4 is mean-preserving and
//    still only reaches 6.03pp at the pool, because the draw is independent
//    per cohort and diversifies away. Measured on the contribution basis
//    (c = dev / R_pool, so the pool rate is exactly sum(c)):
//
//      actual 3.91pp    independent sqrt(sum Var) 4.46pp    comonotone 18.92pp
//      diversification actually taken 4.84x
//      cross-cohort intraclass rho 0.0000
//      n_eff per pool-year: pool 16.35, WC 11.65, GL 4.53, Property 3.36
//
//    n_eff is why rho reaches WC hardest: WC's long tail diversifies itself
//    across nearly twelve effective accident years, and GL has four and a half
//    to begin with. That IS the diagnosis of the original figure — not that
//    each accident year moved too little, but that WC held enough of them for
//    the moves to cancel.
//
//    ⚠ IT STILL REACHES GL, AND ONLY THE PAIRING SHOWS IT. Unpaired, GL's
//    null and shipped SDs overlap and it looks like nothing happened. Paired
//    by seed set, every one rises: 7.85 -> 9.73, 9.04 -> 9.31, 8.06 -> 9.08,
//    a mean 8.32 -> 9.37. GL's estimate is too noisy across seed sets to see a
//    1pp effect any other way, which is the same reason its threshold cannot
//    be used to solve a multiplier.
//
// 3. NOT A CALENDAR-YEAR FACTOR ON THE NET RESERVE, and this option was
//    costed and refused rather than overlooked. Applied outside the claim
//    register it would be exactly mean-preserving and would add tau in
//    quadrature at the pool by arithmetic. It is rejected on two grounds.
//    It duplicates SHOCK EVENTS, which are pool-wide by construction and are
//    the design's own answer to a bad year that moves every line at once —
//    34 of 40 unbuilt. And it costs the PATHWISE reserve identity: netUltimate
//    would leave registerSum permanently, true only in expectation, while
//    maturity-anchor-check — which asserts the GROSS leg — stayed green
//    throughout. A standing identity weakening silently behind a green gate is
//    the exact failure this repo keeps finding, and it is not worth tau.
//
// ⚠ AND THE POOL THRESHOLD CANNOT BE REACHED FROM THIS MECHANISM AT ALL. rho
// is scoped PER LINE-YEAR, so the three lines stay independent of each other.
// Their contributions to the pool rate are WC 2.06 / GL 3.45 / Property 2.11pp,
// which is 4.53pp added independently and 7.61pp perfectly correlated —
// against a 9.06% pool threshold. So no rho and no multiplier reaches it, and
// the answer is shock events rather than a wider reserve draw. That is the
// finding, not the shortfall.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE SOLVE. Grid at 80 games to locate, confirmed at 150 games on three
// independent seed sets, run through the SHIPPED constants rather than a
// patched engine — the mechanism was built defaulting to the null first, so
// the solve measured the code that ships. Every SE is jackknifed ACROSS GAMES:
// the ten years of one game share an opening and a reserve stock, and pooling
// them as independent understates the SE about threefold.
//
// WC residual SD at rho 0.90, by scale, on the three seed sets:
//
//   scale 2.10    7.18 / 6.72 / 6.93    mean 6.94
//   scale 2.40    7.45 / 6.74 / 7.15    mean 7.11
//   scale 2.80    7.65 / 6.83 / 7.41    mean 7.30     <- shipped
//
// ⚠ 2.80 BECAUSE IT IS THE MEASURED CELL THAT CLEARS, AND FOR NO STRONGER
// REASON THAN THAT. 2.40 lands at 7.11 against a 7.21 threshold and 2.80 at
// 7.30; the seed-to-seed spread at a fixed scale is 0.45-0.8pp, so THE TWO
// ARE NOT DISTINGUISHABLE FROM EACH OTHER and neither is distinguishable from
// the threshold. The tie is broken by direction: the mechanism exists so that
// a one-sigma bad year costs more than a year's investment income, and of the
// two cells actually run, one has a point estimate above that line and one
// below. Interpolating to ~2.6 would put the estimate on the line and would be
// a number no run returned.
//
// ⚠ AND DO NOT KEEP CLIMBING. The lever has saturated: 2.10 -> 2.40 -> 2.80
// buys 0.17pp then 0.19pp, because reserveStepSigma solves sigma to hit a
// target and that map compresses hard at large targets. Past here the
// multiplier grows much faster than the dispersion it buys, and the multiplier
// is the term that widens marginals. If WC needs materially more than this,
// the answer is another mechanism, not a bigger number here.
//
// ⚠ rho 0.90 AND NOT 1.00, AND IT IS A CLOSE CALL STATED HONESTLY. Every rho
// from 0.75 to 1.00 hits the WC target with the right scale, and the scale it
// needs falls as rho rises — roughly 2.6 at rho 0.75 down to roughly 1.9 at
// rho 1.00. Those two ends are single-seed-set reads and the seed-to-seed
// spread is ~0.45pp, so take the ORDERING as measured and not the endpoints;
// only rho 0.90 was solved on three seed sets. The rate-noise cost does not
// separate them either — GL's robust spread reads 4.67 / 4.70 / 4.72% at rho
// 0.75 / 0.90 / 1.00 against 4.76% on the null, i.e. flat at every rho.
// Higher rho is cheaper in multiplier, and the multiplier is the knob
// that widens marginals, so the pull is toward 1.00. What holds it below:
// at rho = 1 the calendar term is comonotone, every cohort's factor a
// monotone function of one number, and the effective sample of any statistic
// that averages over cohorts within a line-year goes to exactly ONE rather
// than merely small. That is not hypothetical — maturity-anchor-check needed
// its sample tripled at this commit for precisely that reason, and 0.90 keeps
// a real idiosyncratic component (weight sqrt(0.10) = 0.32) so no two accident
// years ever take an identical calendar factor. The cost of the choice is
// measured and it is the scale: 2.80 instead of roughly 1.9.
//
// ⚠ AND rho = 0.90 DOES NOT MAKE THE RESERVE COMONOTONE — it makes ONE TERM
// INSIDE IT correlated. The realised cross-cohort correlation of actual cohort
// development within a line-year, which is what an observer of the reserve
// sees, measures 0.268 / 0.283 / 0.264 on WC at the shipped cell across the
// three seed sets, against 0.015 / 0.014 / 0.014 on the null. About 0.27, not
// 0.90: the per-claim law stays fully idiosyncratic and it owns most of the
// variance, so what rho correlates is a minority term.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT IT COSTS THE PLAYER — the year-over-year log change in
// purePremiumPer100, which is the rate jitter a pool actually sees. SEED-
// MATCHED pairs, null against shipped, 150 games, two independent seed sets:

// ⚠ NOTHING BELOW IS LIVE. PER_CLAIM_REVISION.enabled is false and the cohort
// IBNER path above is untouched. This block is the fitted record; claimRevision.ts
// is the mechanism; terminal-severity-check.ts derives the one free parameter.

// What it replaces, when it is flipped: the cohort-level lognormal step above
// develops `netUltimate` top-down against IBNER_TOTAL_SD, and
// developmentAllocation then spreads that movement over the claims. Stage 1
// inverts it — each open claim revises its own CASE RESERVE, and the cohort's
// ultimate is the sum. The register stops being frozen at inception.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE BASIS IS THE CASE RESERVE, AND IT IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS SHAPE WORKS.
//
// Stage 0 measured what a paid-to-date floor on the INCURRED costs: 42.5% of
// cohort ultimate on WC, 15.3% on GL, 4.5% on Property, against a martingale
// tolerance near 1%. That is not a residual defect in the payment split — the
// split was rebuilt and it only fell from 55.4% — it is structural. A large
// claim's annual revision SD is the same order as the headroom ANY coherent
// payment schedule can leave on a file that has been paying for years, so no
// split closes it. claimClosure.ts's own header sets out the choice this
// resolves.
//
// A mean-one multiplicative factor on a POSITIVE reserve is bounded away from
// zero by construction, so nothing truncates and there is no floor to hit. The
// conversion is one division:
//
//   magnitude_on_reserve = magnitude_on_incurred / headroom,   per claim
//
// where headroom is the share of the claim still unpaid. A claim 90% paid gets
// a 10x larger factor on its remaining tenth, which is the same dollar
// movement — that is what makes the two bases equivalent rather than a
// re-scaling.
//
// ===========================================================================
// MAGNITUDE — 200% / (age + 1), IN MODEL TERMS, AND THE OFFSET IS NOT COSMETIC.
//
// ⚠ AND THE MAGNITUDE IS ON THE INCURRED, WITH THE HEADROOM CORRECTION MOVED
// OUT TO ITS OWN CONSTANT — A DATA RULING. s used to be phi.m/headroom so that
// the DOLLAR movement was invariant to how much of a claim had been paid. The
// pool's own GL experience, banded by headroom, value-weighted within band, open
// claims, pre-game excluded, says movement scales WITH headroom instead:
//
//   headroom      |move| / incurred      |move| / reserve
//   h < 5%              0.015                  0.997

//
// A claim under 5% headroom moves 1.5% of its incurred, not 79%. That direction
// is settled and nothing below reopens it. HOW FAST movement scales with

// still leave 0.50 as the right call, for reasons that are about WHICH part of
// the source is trustworthy rather than about goodness of fit.
//
// ===========================================================================
// 1. THE ANCHOR DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE. THE EXPONENT IS A FREE CHOICE.
//
// phi is re-solved against CLAIM_SETTLED_LOG_SD_ANCHOR at every exponent, and
// every one of them lands the terminal settled log-SD at 2.2900 exactly:
//
//   e      0.00    0.25    0.35    0.50    0.75    1.00    1.25
//   phi   0.6452  0.6527  0.6590  0.6699  0.6907  0.7123  0.7345
//
// phi moves 4% across the entire range of exponents anyone has argued for —
// from the form where h cancels completely to one steeper than the naive fit.
// The reason is the variance budget at phi's own note: phi is solved against a
// small residual, so large changes in the walk move the terminal log-SD very
// little.
//
// ⚠ SO THE LOAD-BEARING GATE OF STAGE 1 CANNOT SEE THIS PARAMETER, and anyone
// re-solving phi later should know the anchor will not object to whatever
// exponent it is solved under. terminal-severity-check going green says nothing
// about whether the exponent is right. What discriminates is the band shape
// below and the engine's cohort spread — neither of which is an anchor.
//
// ===========================================================================
// 2. WC AND PROPERTY CANNOT BE SCORED. THIS IS A GL CHOICE APPLIED BY ASSUMPTION.
//
// Measured on the model, both lines read exactly 0.000 in the h < 5% and
// h > 65% bands, because their payout patterns never put a cohort's headroom
// there: WC's first valuation sits at 59% headroom and Property's at 49.6%, and
// their IBNER horizons truncate before headroom falls under 5%. Only GL spans
// the range, reaching 90.4%. Any shape score for the other two lines is
// arithmetic over two structurally empty cells and means nothing — theirs came
// out at 0.62-0.65 against GL's 0.185 and that difference is an artefact of the
// empty cells, not a worse fit.
//
// The source band table is GL's. So the exponent is chosen on GL evidence and
// carried to WC and Property by assumption, exactly as CLAIM_SETTLED_LOG_SD_
// ANCHOR and CLAIM_REVISION_SIZE_TREND are. Say so wherever those lines'
// figures are quoted.
//
// ===========================================================================
// 3. THE FORM IS WRONG AND THE DECISION IS RIGHT.
//
// The source has TWO REGIMES, not one slope. Taking the recorded band table
// above and reading the exponent between adjacent band midpoints:
//
//   0.025 -> 0.100     e = 1.05     the two thinnest rows in the table
//   0.100 -> 0.229     e = 2.36     the steep segment, and it rests on the
//                                   thinnest row of all
//   0.229 -> 0.477     e = 0.72
//   0.477 -> 0.806     e = 0.05     essentially FLAT
//
// A factor of 47 between the steepest and flattest segment. No single power has
// two slopes, so a single exponent must sit in the middle and be wrong at both
// ends — which is visible in the sweep: the exponent that matches the collapse
// regime is furthest wrong on the flat one and vice versa. The choice is which
// regime to fit, and it is ABOVE 15% HEADROOM, because the three bands above
// that hold the overwhelming majority of the pool's claims while the collapse
// regime rests on the two thinnest rows in the table. Fitting both at once is
// what produced the h^1.0 reading that put this at e = 1.
//
// ⚠ AND 0.50 REPRODUCES THE LOW-HEADROOM FLOOR'S EFFECT WITHOUT IMPOSING ONE.
// The model's h < 5% band reads 0.014 against the source's 0.015 at this
// exponent — not because a knee was built, but because the model's own size
// trend and its development path correlate m with h. So the argument for a
// two-regime form or an explicit floor loses most of its value: it would buy a
// knee position and a second slope fitted to the two thinnest rows in the table,
// to reproduce something the single power already delivers.
//
// A TWO-REGIME FORM IS THE BETTER DESCRIPTION AND WAS NOT BUILT, DELIBERATELY.
// If a low-headroom band ever arrives with a serious sample behind it, that is
// the thing to revisit. A saturating hyperbola h/(h+h0) was checked and is the
// WRONG FAMILY — it is concave, so it cannot produce a sharp low-h collapse at
// all. Do not reach for it.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHY 0.50 AND NOT ITS NEIGHBOURS — the sweep, on shape and on the engine.
//
// SHAPE. Each table normalised to its own top band, RMS against the source's
// normalised shape. "thick" is the three bands above 15% headroom:
//

//   0.00       0.282             0.154
//   0.25       0.301             0.140   <- best on the thick bands
//   0.35       0.221             0.161

//
// ENGINE. 40 games x 20 years, robust spread of pre-cession cohort development,

//   0.25     12.14 / 13.59 / 9.43   180.81 / 89.14 / 205.68%     1.62/2.00/2.25

//   1.00      5.65 /  7.17 / 6.77    78.99 / 66.75 /  65.57%     0.75/1.06/1.61
//
// NOT 1.0. At that exponent the law makes WC develop LESS than the cohort path
// it supersedes — 0.75x. That is a qualitative defect rather than a magnitude
// preference, and 0.50 puts all three lines above 1.0.
//
// NOT 0.25, even though it wins the thick bands. The tail restarts: 181% on WC
// and 206% on Property against 63-88% at 0.50. The whole reason e = 0 was
// retired was the tail, and buying shape back at the price of reopening it is
// the trade that ruling already refused.
//
// NOT 0.35 — AND IT IS RECORDED HERE AS THE CANDIDATE TO REVISIT. It is the
// SLOPE-OPTIMAL choice: the model's realised log-log slope at a nominal 0.35 is
// h^0.477, against the source's above-15% regime of h^0.48. (Realised slope runs
// ABOVE nominal e at every exponent, because m rises as claims develop and
// headroom falls.) It was not taken because it is law-level only — it has no
// engine measurement and no ledger run behind it — while 0.50 has both, already
// holds the tail, and already fixes the WC reversal. The gain is one regime's
// slope against a measured value. Revisit 0.35 if a low-headroom band ever
// arrives with a serious sample, or if the level question below is settled.
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠ OPEN, AND LARGER THAN THE EXPONENT: THE BAND LEVELS ARE ~7x APART.
//
// The model's |move|/incurred tops out at 0.10-0.11 per band where the source
// reads 0.45-0.79. That gap is a near-constant factor across bands and it is
// present AT EVERY EXPONENT, because the level is set by phi and phi is pinned
// by the terminal-severity anchor. No exponent addresses it. It cancels under
// normalisation, which is why the shape comparison above is the one that carries
// information.
//
// ⚠ IT IS THE 84-VERSUS-9.8 GAP AGAIN, SEEN PER-CLAIM RATHER THAN PER-COHORT.
// That item is recorded as CLOSED at CLAIM_MOVEMENT_BY_AGE_TARGET, on
// survivorship the model cannot have, a denominator worth x0.756, and a
// numerator dominated by a placeholder phenomenon the model does not model. Those
// compound to roughly 2x. They do not compound to 7x. So one of two things is
// true and this file does not yet know which:
//
//   EITHER the closure was too generous — one or more of those three factors is
//     doing less work than it was credited with, and the residual is real;
//   OR the remaining factor is the STEP-AND-BASIS question: the source ratio's
//     step length and its denominator are not established to be the model's
//     per-model-age step on carried incurred, and a mismatch there would show up
//     as exactly this — a constant multiple, invariant to the exponent.
//
// ⚠ NOBODY SHOULD TUNE AGAINST THE BAND LEVELS UNTIL THAT IS SETTLED. Pinning
// the source ratio's step length and denominator basis is the next measurement,
// and it is a measurement rather than a fit.
//
// AND KEEP THE TWO EFFECTS IN PROPORTION. The exponent move lifts cohort spread
// against the retired constants from 0.23/0.36/0.45 to 0.33/0.51/0.53 — a
// relative gain of 43/42/18%, but only 13/23/15% of the distance remaining to
// 1.0x. So the exponent is the smaller half of the quietness question and this
// level item is the larger one. It is not the law's to fix until the two ratios
// are known to be the same quantity.

// SIZE TREND — CONTINUOUS, AND THE CONTINUITY IS THE POINT.
//
//   m(v) = 20.12 x v^-0.2891      v in dollars, m a fraction of incurred
//
// ⚠ IT MUST NOT BE A STEP FUNCTION. The obvious fit is two or three size bands,
// and a band boundary lands on or near the $1M occurrence retention. A
// discontinuity in revision magnitude exactly at the retention is the
// free-lunch shape: a claim a dollar under the boundary and one a dollar over
// develop at different rates, so the cession a player receives jumps at a
// threshold they can see. A continuous power law has no such edge anywhere.
//
// ⚠ THE EXPONENT SURVIVED A CHALLENGE AND THE CHALLENGE IS WORTH RECORDING.
// The suspicion was that -0.2891 is a COUNT-BASIS ARTEFACT — fitted where small
// claims dominate the count, and therefore not a statement about the value the
// pool actually carries. It is not. On a value-weighted basis the pool's two
// largest size bands differ by a factor of 2.76, against the 2.8 this exponent
// predicts for the same pair. Large claims genuinely revise about a third as
// much proportionally as mid-size ones, and the exponent is a value-basis fact.
//
// ⚠ AND THAT IS WHAT CLOSED THE MOVEMENT TARGET — see
// CLAIM_MOVEMENT_BY_AGE_TARGET. Once the exponent is real, a value-weighted
// movement of 110% of cohort incurred cannot be a statement about proportional
// revision, because the value sits in the bands that move LEAST.
//
// ⚠ ALL THREE LINES RUN THIS EXPONENT, AND IT IS GL'S. There is no per-line
// size trend — this is a bare object, not a Record keyed by line, and nothing
// in src/ or scripts/ indexes it by line. The same is true of
// CLAIM_REVISION_FREQUENCY: q = 0.70 is one scalar for every claim on every
// line. So the plan's domain read that "Property revision probability falls
// steeply with claim size" reached the code in NEITHER form — not as a Property
// slope on the magnitude, and not at all as a size-conditional FREQUENCY, which
// the model does not have anywhere. That is the explanation for Property's
// cession rising furthest under the law, and it is a separate commit: giving
// Property its own slope is a re-fit, and adding a size-conditional frequency
// is a new mechanism. Recorded here so the next reader does not re-derive it.
//
// ⚠ THE s TAIL THIS CONSTANT FED IS SHUT, AND IT IS THE EXPONENT THAT SHUT IT.
// The size trend is still what makes s vary between claims. Under s = phi.m/h,
// at the median tracked occurrence on the payout pattern's headroom, s reached
// 22.75 on GL by age 8 and 3.80 on Property by age 4, with 15.6% of tracked
// value sitting at s >= 10 where E|f-1|/s had collapsed to 0.133. At the shipped
// exponent the same table reads 1.84 and 1.01. The engine's worst cohort is
// 63-88% of register against 2950%.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS A TAIL HELD, NOT A DIVISOR REMOVED, AND THE REASON MATTERS. h^-0.5
// still diverges, and the engine divides by the cohort's REALISED balance rather
// than by the pattern, which goes lower still. What killed the tail is that the
// delta no longer cancels the divisor: movement goes as sqrt(h), so a large s
// arrives exactly where the balance it multiplies is vanishing. Re-measure if
// the exponent ever moves down — at e = 0 the cancellation is exact again.
//
// ⚠ NOTHING TESTS THIS WHERE IT DOES ITS WORK, and that gap is real and stays
// open. composition-table-check validates the AGE curve on a count basis, and
// its only sensitivity to this constant is a floor asserting it does NOT bind.
// At GL model age 1 the size trend binds on 14.3% of claims by COUNT and 95.9%
// by VALUE, so the gate and this constant do not meet. The measured cost of
// closing the gap is recorded at that gate's head.

// ⚠ WHY IT WENT, AND THE TRADE IS NOT CLOSE. Sign persistence makes each step
// CONDITIONALLY non-mean-one, so a runoff drifts UP, and the settlement level
// existed to pay that back. Once the ledger crossing was closed by putting the
// settlement factor on the RESERVE, that offset became h-scaled — the required
// level is (1/persistence - 1)/h and h is a cohort quantity that varies by line,
// age and realised development, so no scalar cancels it. The drift stopped being

// tolerance from one term.

// rate still reads 57.0 / 55.5 / 66.9% against the pool's 59%, because the

// itself. Six percent of drift in the ultimate for four points on a statistic
// that was already three-quarters delivered is not a trade.

// FITTED from OBSERVED reserve-change directions and APPLIED as a LATENT chain,
// on a model whose observable direction is dominated by something else entirely.

// three points fit a zero-inflated lognormal on the non-zero part, and the
// SHAPE below is that fit.
//
// ⚠ THE MEAN IS NOT MEASURED, IT IS DERIVED, AND IT HAS TO BE. Sign persistence
// breaks the step-by-step martingale: given the previous sign, the next factor
// is not conditionally mean-one, and over a runoff that compounds into a real
// upward drift in E[ultimate]. The settlement factor's mean is solved so the
// cohort is a martingale WITH rho in force. Fitting the mean as well would
// double-book the same experience and leave the drift in.
//
// So `nonZeroScale` is a SOLVED number, not a fitted one, and martingale-
// equivalence-check is what falsifies it. The measured shape is preserved
// exactly: the zero mass and the log-spread are fixed, only the level moves.
//
// ⚠ IT IS WIRED INTO THE ENGINE AS OF THIS COMMIT, AND FOR TWO COMMITS IT WAS
// NOT. settlementFactor had no caller in src/ outside claimRevision.ts: the
// engine routed processIbner through reviseDevelopingSet and nothing else, so a
// claim that pierced the retention and settled at 0.74x handed nothing back.
// The gate could not see it — it paired a MEASURED persistence term with this
// CLOSED-FORM mean, and a closed form cannot disagree with an implementation.
// Both terms are now measured, and the gate carries an ENGINE ARM that asserts
// current_on === current_off x settlementFactor claim by claim, exactly, at the
// valuation each claim closes. Verified to fail: un-wiring the engine block
// turns that arm red 24 of 24 while leaving every statistical term green.
//
// ⚠ THE ENGINE APPLIES IT TO THE RESERVE, NOT TO THE WHOLE VALUE, AND THAT
// CHANGES WHAT THE LEVEL DELIVERS THERE. settleClosingSet computes
// v.h.(f - 1) with h the cohort's balance over its register, because the
// unbounded form — the factor on the whole carried value — was half of the
// ledger crossing. Two consequences, both measured:
//
//   IT MAKES "CLOSES AT ZERO" LITERALLY TRUE. A claim settling at factor 0 now
//   lands at v.(1 - h), its paid to date, rather than at nothing.
//
//   ⚠ AND IT COLLAPSED THE OFFSET, WHICH IS WHAT RETIRED rho. The expected effect
//   on a claim's value is 1 + h.(E[f] - 1) rather than E[f], so an offset arrives
//   scaled by the cohort's h. The required level was (1/persistence - 1)/h and h
//   varies by cohort, so no scalar could cancel the drift — the engine ran +6.04%
//   pre-cession on WC. The resolution was to remove the drift rather than chase
//   the offset: see CLAIM_REVISION_PERSISTENCE_RHO.
//
// ⚠ WITH NO DRIFT TO CANCEL, THE LEVEL IS THE ONE THAT MAKES THIS FACTOR
// MEAN-ONE OUTRIGHT, AND THE h PROBLEM DISSOLVES. 1 + h.(1 - 1) = 1 for every h.
// Measured on the engine, paired off against on, the settlement quotient now
// reads 0.997 / 1.000 / 0.999 — neutral, which is what it should be.
//
// ⚠ AND IT DOES NOT REDUCE CESSION, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT WAS
// EXPECTED TO DO. Settlement was reasoned about as the FAVOURABLE force — a
// claim above the retention settling low hands the layer back. It does hand
// back on the downside, but cession is CONVEX in occurrence size and this
// factor is a large mean-neutral dispersion (19% at zero against a p90 of
// 1.60) applied to every claim at closure. By Jensen the up-tail cedes more
// than the down-tail returns. Measured, 200 games, flag ON against OFF: total
// expected recovery per line-year moves 1.16x on WC, 1.02x on GL and 1.20x on
// Property WITH settlement, against 1.07 / 1.01 / 1.01 without it. Wiring the

// phi = 4.2 IS A CORRECT MEASUREMENT of the pool's revision process. The
// matched-slice check reproduces the source's own widening at 1.265 against
// 1.285, so the number is right about the thing it measures.
//
// IT CANNOT BE APPLIED AT FACE VALUE, because the model's severity draw has
// ALREADY SPENT MOST OF IT. The GL mixture was fitted to SETTLED claim values,
// not to first estimates, so its log-SD of about 2.14 already contains the
// revision history of the claims it was fitted to. The pool's settled log-SD is
// 2.29. Applying a full phi = 4.2 on top of a distribution that is already
// 2.14 wide would count the same widening twice and put the model's terminal
// severity far past anything the pool has seen.
//
// ⚠ AND phi HERE IS NOT THE ADDENDUM'S phi. THE PARAMETERISATION CHANGED AT THE
// ANCHOR SOLVE, AND A NOTE THAT STOOD HERE COMPARED THE TWO AS IF IT HAD NOT.
//
// In claimRevision.ts, phi is a STRAIGHT MULTIPLIER on the magnitude:
//     s = phi x magnitude x headroom^-0.5,  factor = exp(sign.s.|Z| - s^2/2)
// so `s` is the log-SD of the mean-one factor and phi is dimensionless. The
// addendum's phi is e^(s^2) — an SD-to-median ratio, bounded below by 1 by
// construction. THE TWO NUMBERS ARE NOT COMPARABLE.
//
// Converting at GL age 1 (count-weighted magnitude 0.934, headroom 0.904):
//     phi_here 0.6699 ->  s = 0.658 ->  e^(s^2) = 1.54 in the addendum's units
//     addendum 1.9    ->  s = 0.801
//     addendum 4.2    ->  s = 1.198
// The conversion has barely moved across all three headroom exponents (it read
// 1.53 under both predecessors) — at GL age 1 headroom is 0.904, so any power of
// it is near 1 and the exponent has almost no leverage this early. It bites late
// in a runoff, not here.
//
// ⚠ SO THE EARLIER NOTE'S "ABOUT 3x TOO BIG" WAS A UNITS ERROR OF MINE, and it
// is corrected here rather than left to mislead the next investigation. On a
// like-for-like basis the anchor solve lands at 1.53 against the briefed
// residual of 1.9 — about 19% lower in s, not a factor of three.
//
// WHAT THE VARIANCE-BUDGET ARGUMENT STILL SHOWS, because it is unaffected by the
// units. The 2.14-vs-2.29 derivation nets out the severity fit's own spread and
// stops; it does not net out the settlement factor's fitted log-sigma of 0.5297,
// worth 0.2806 of log-variance and not phi's to spend. Measured: at phi = 0 the
// settlement shape ALONE carries the model from a drawn 2.1668 to 2.2304, over
// half of the 2.1668 -> 2.29 gap consumed before the revision law contributes
// anything. That is what accounts for landing at 1.53 rather than 1.9.
//
// ⚠ IT IS THE SAME DOUBLE-COUNT THE COMBINE RULE ALREADY REJECTS, one level up.
// CLAIM_REVISION_COMBINE takes the minimum of age and size "because both were
// fitted on the same experience, so multiplying double-counts". The settlement
// factor was fitted on that same experience too.
//
// SOLVED, not asserted: 0.6252 / 0.6273 / 0.6285 on the three largest samples
// (309k / 98k / 147k claims), 0.5492 and 0.5665 on the two others. The spread
// tracks the drawn log-SD — a wider draw leaves less residual — and the value
// below is taken from the configuration that matches a real game's year range.
//
// ⚠ RE-SOLVED TWICE AS THE HEADROOM SCALING CHANGED, AND BARELY MOVING IS THE
// POINT. It was 0.63 while s = phi.m/h, 0.7123 at s = phi.m, and 0.6699 at the
// shipped s = phi.m/sqrt(h). The whole range over which the exponent has been
// argued moves phi by 4% — see the table at CLAIM_REVISION_HEADROOM_EXPONENT,
// where every exponent from 0.00 to 1.25 lands the anchor at 2.2900 exactly.
// The reason is the variance budget above: phi is solved against a small
// residual, so a large change in the walk moves the terminal log-SD very little.
//
// ⚠ WHICH MEANS THE ANCHOR CANNOT SEE THE EXPONENT, and terminal-severity-check
// going green is not evidence that the headroom scaling is right. Whoever
// re-solves phi next should read that note before concluding anything from this
// one.

// 2.6331 at 4.2 — it flattens against a ceiling near 2.633. The mean-one factor
// exp(s.sign.|Z| - s^2/2) has median exp(-s^2/2), so at large s the drift term
// collapses carried values toward zero faster than the spread term widens them.
// Two consequences worth stating: the model has a hard ceiling near 2.62 that no
// phi can pass, and any phi above ~3 has a twin that reads the same. phi = 4.2
// could therefore never have been applied here at face value even if the fit had
// spent nothing — which strengthens the double-count argument rather than

//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ CLOSED, NOT DEFERRED: THIS SERIES IS NOT A TARGET THE MODEL CAN MATCH, AND
// NONE OF THE THREE REASONS IS A DEFECT IN THE LAW.
//
// The model realises 11.1% at model age 1 against this series' 110%. That gap
// was chased for three commits as if it were one number with one cause. It is
// three basis mismatches, and once each is named the residual is not a defect.
// The series stays in the file as the RECORD of what the pool did; it is no
// longer something the law is expected to reproduce, and no phi, no
// re-parameterisation and no re-fit will make it reproduce it.
//
// 1. SURVIVORSHIP — STRUCTURAL AND UNCLOSABLE.
//    The series is measured on claims OPEN at the earlier valuation, and in the
//    pool that subset is systematically adverse: it grows 1.30x to 1.49x a year
//    while the whole cohort grows 1.09x to 1.11x. Cheap claims close, so the
//    survivors are the ones that grew.
//    THE MODEL CANNOT HAVE THIS. Closure resolves from the DRAWN value and its
//    unit hashes (gameId, claimId) — see simulationEngine's isClaimClosed call
//    site — so staying open is size-correlated and GROWTH-INDEPENDENT. Measured
//    across three lines, six age steps, with and without the settlement factor,
//    the model's open subset grows 0.97x to 1.01x. It is mean-one to within
//    half a percent because it was built to be.
//    ⚠ THE SIZE OF THIS: at GL ages 1-3 the target's PURE DRIFT COMPONENT alone
//    exceeds the model's entire realised movement — 0.355 / 0.237 / 0.177 of
//    cohort incurred against the model's whole 0.111 / 0.093 / 0.076. No
//    dispersion argument is needed to see the two are different quantities.
//    Closing it would mean making closure depend on the revision path, which
//    claimClosure.ts prohibits for unrelated and stronger reasons.
//
// 2. DENOMINATOR — MECHANICAL, WORTH x0.756 OR BETTER.
//    The series divides by the pool's BOOKED INCURRED at that valuation. The
//    model divides by the sum of DRAWN grossUltimate — see composition-table-
//    check's `total`. In the model those are the same object: the register is
//    drawn AT ultimate and the law is mean-one, so measured booked(age)/drawn
//    runs 1.000 to 1.009. In the pool they are not: its cohort incurred grows
//    9-11% a year, so an early valuation's denominator is materially below
//    ultimate. Over the three measured steps that is x1.322, so restating this
//    series onto the model's denominator multiplies it by at most 0.756 —
//    less if development continues past the measured window.
//
// 3. NUMERATOR COMPOSITION — THE 110% IS A TAIL STATEMENT, NOT A MAGNITUDE ONE.
//    Value-weighted movement within size band falls by two orders of magnitude
//    from the smallest band to the largest, and the small bands dominate the
//    numerator. A claim under $10k moves many times its own incurred: that is
//    near-zero reserves becoming real claims — the placeholder phenomenon
//    already excluded at data age 1 (see CLAIM_REVISION_MAGNITUDE_NUMERATOR),
//    reappearing at every age in the small bands. THE MODEL HAS NO PLACEHOLDER
//    STAGE BY DESIGN: a $500 drawn claim is a $500 claim, and the severity draw
//    delivers it already valued. The two largest bands, where the model and the
//    pool are describing the same thing, agree — see the exponent's own
//    validation at CLAIM_REVISION_SIZE_TREND.
//
// ⚠ AND THE CEILING FINDING WEAKENED ONCE (2) WAS APPLIED. This is worth
// keeping because it is the reason the RESERVE BASIS is not the constraint.
// E[f] = 1 with f >= 0 gives E|f-1| <= 2, so movement/incurred can never exceed
// 2 x openShare x headroom x q for ANY mean-one factor on the reserve. Against
// that ceiling this series sat at 91 / 76 / 86 / 76 / 81% — close enough to a
// degenerate limit to read as an impossibility proof, and it was reported as
// one. Restated onto the model's denominator it sits at 69 / 57 / 65 / 58 /
// 61%, and with (1)'s drift removed the dispersion the model must supply is
// about 41% of the ceiling at age 1. The reserve basis has room. It only looked
// incapable because it was being compared against an unrestated statistic.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ AND THE CLOSURE HAS SINCE BEEN QUESTIONED FROM A SECOND DIRECTION. READ THIS
// BEFORE CITING THE THREE REASONS ABOVE AS SETTLED.
//
// The same gap reappears PER CLAIM rather than per cohort: banded by headroom,
// the model's |move|/incurred tops out at 0.10-0.11 where the source reads
// 0.45-0.79, a near-constant ~7x at every headroom exponent. The three reasons
// above compound to roughly 2x, not 7x. So either one of them is doing less work
// than it was credited with, or there is a fourth factor — the step-and-basis
// question — and this file does not yet know which. The full statement of it,
// with both possibilities named, is the open item at
// CLAIM_REVISION_HEADROOM_EXPONENT.
//
// WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT DO TO THIS NOTE. It does not restore this series
// as a target: survivorship is still structural and the model still has no
// placeholder stage, so no phi and no re-fit make the model reproduce it. What
// it does is remove the right to treat the SIZE of the residual as accounted
// for. "Not a target" and "fully explained" are different claims, and only the
// first is established.

// The composition that validates the law's FORM is
//     movement(age) = magnitude(age) x open share(age)

//
// THAT FINDING DOES NOT EXIST. The series is this model's own value-weighted
// open register, measured at the END of each model age. b206cc6's gate compared
// it against a START-of-age measurement, and the whole "widening ratio" was that
// one-age offset. Aligned correctly the ratio is 1.00 / 0.99 / 0.99 / 1.07 / 1.27
// rather than 1.08 / 1.13 / 1.25 / 1.52 / 2.28.
//
// HOW IT WAS SETTLED, since a label is worth nothing without a check. Measured
// at 12 independent registers x 40 replicates: the model's value-weighted open
// share at model age a+1 reproduces this series with an RMS error of 2.23pp
// against 16.66pp unshifted, exact at the first entry and 0.3 across-register sd
// at the fourth. And the regression hypothesis is excluded on both candidates —
// the revision law cannot touch it (the gate resolves the closure curve from the
// DRAWN value and accumulates the DRAWN value, so the law is not in that path),
// and 858f9ba moved the model TOWARD this series, not away: before it GL had a
// single size-independent curve reading 73.5 / 44.0 / 23.4 / 11.3 / 5.0.
//
// SO IT IS A REGRESSION REFERENCE AND NOTHING MORE. Comparing the model to it
// says whether the model has moved. It says nothing about the pool, and any
// future reader reaching for it as an external anchor is repeating b206cc6.

//
// WHAT REPLACES THEM IS NOT A THIRD TARGET. Under Stage 1 the total SD of a

// register's size mix and the closure curve, and there is no constant to set.
// The emergent figures under a GL-derived phi are a reading, not a target.

//
//   s = phi.m/h        35.1 / 20.4 / 14.8%   worst cohort 2950%, sample SD 169%
//   s = phi.m           5.65 / 7.17 / 6.77%  worst cohort 79%,   sample SD 7.79%

// against a flag-off arm of 7.51 / 6.78 / 4.20%. The shipped middle row is
// 1.11x / 1.49x / 1.89x of the path it replaces and 0.33 / 0.51 / 0.53 of the
// retired constants.
//
// TWO THINGS THE MIDDLE ROW SHOWS THAT THE OTHERS DO NOT. The tail stays shut —
// the estimability problem that the 1/h form created is closed, and the
// martingale's persistence SE stays tight. And the law develops MORE than the
// cohort lognormal on every line, which s = phi.m did not: at that exponent WC
// read 0.75x, i.e. the replacement was quieter than the thing it replaced. That
// reversal is what the exponent move fixed, and it was a qualitative defect
// rather than a magnitude preference. Recorded so the next reader sees the size
// of the move rather than rediscovering it.
//
// ⚠ AND ~0.5x OF THE RETIRED CONSTANTS IS STILL NOT 1.0x. That is not a target

// The movement-by-age target is the last item and it resolved as NOT MATCHABLE,
// for three basis reasons none of which is a defect in the law. The full record
// is at CLAIM_MOVEMENT_BY_AGE_TARGET; the short form is survivorship the model
// cannot have by construction, a denominator worth x0.756, and a numerator
// dominated by a placeholder phenomenon the model does not model by design.
// Anyone reopening it should read that note before measuring anything.
//
// ⚠ AND ONE ITEM HAS SINCE REOPENED IN A NARROW SENSE — THE LEVEL, NOT THE
// TARGET. The per-band movement level sits ~7x below the source's at every
// headroom exponent, and the three reasons above compound to about 2x. The
// target stays closed; the SIZE of the residual is not accounted for. Full
// statement, with both candidate explanations, at

//                                  — but the anchor cannot see the headroom
//                                  exponent, so it is not evidence for that
//   emergent cohort SD             0.33 / 0.51 / 0.53 of the retired constants,
//                                  1.11 / 1.49 / 1.89x of the path it replaces
//   headroom exponent              0.50, chosen on GL band shape and the
//                                  engine's tail, recorded as a regime choice
//   martingale                     passes, persistence and settlement
//                                  decomposed separately
//   pre-game acceptance            unmoved on all three lines, no fallbacks
//   sign persistence               gated, with its rho = 0 control arm

//                                  standing gates
//
// ⚠ RESOLVED — THE LEDGER CROSSING IS CLOSED, BY AN INEQUALITY RATHER THAN A
// FLOOR. reviseDevelopingSet now takes the cohort's BALANCE and derives the
// headroom from it, h = balance / register total, so every claim's movement is
// a share of the balance it lands in: d_i = B.w_i.(f_i - 1) >= -B.w_i with
// sum(w) = 1 and every f_i >= 0, hence sum(d) >= -B. The bound survives cession
// because the retained function is non-decreasing, 1-Lipschitz and zero at zero.
// settleClosingSet puts the settlement factor inside the same h. The full
// argument is at those two functions; cohort-ledger-check asserts the outcome on
// BOTH arms and reads 0 violations across 81,312 flag-on cohort-valuations at 6x
// its shipped sample. Its EXPECTED_RED entry is gone.
//
// ⚠ AND h IS THE SAME IN THE FACTOR AND IN THE DELTA. s = phi.m.h^-0.5 and
// d = v.h.(f-1), so to first order a claim's movement goes as sqrt(h) — half the
// h cancels and half survives, and the surviving half is the ruling at
// CLAIM_REVISION_HEADROOM_EXPONENT. The fix corrects WHICH reserve the movement
// is a share of; the exponent decides how much a claim moves. Feeding the two
// different h's — the pattern's to one and the cohort's to the other — is what
// caused the crossing in the first place and must not come back.
//
// THE REJECTED ALTERNATIVE, RECORDED: h = netUnpaid / netUltimate tracks the
// pattern headroom almost exactly on healthy cohorts (median 0.945 / 0.976 /
// 1.000 of it) and would have been the smaller change, but its bound needs
// sum(claim values) <= netUltimate and the register EXCEEDS netUltimate on 89%
// of cohort-valuations — median 1.31x, p95 2.86x — because the register is GROSS
// and netUltimate is NET. It would have gone green on the seeds it was built
// against and red on someone else's.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT COST WAS THE SETTLEMENT OFFSET, AND THAT ITEM IS NOW CLOSED BY
// RETIRING rho. The offset became h-scaled and therefore uncancellable; with the
// sign chain gone there is no drift to cancel, the settlement level is re-solved
// to mean-one, and a mean-one factor is mean-one at every h. See
// CLAIM_REVISION_PERSISTENCE_RHO and CLAIM_SETTLEMENT_FACTOR.
//
// ⚠ AND THE HEADROOM FIX IS INDEPENDENT OF rho — MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED.
// cohort-ledger-check reads 0 violations on both arms with the chain removed,
// across 9,373 flag-on cohort-valuations. The bound is arithmetic on the
// weights; it never referred to the sign.
//
// ⚠ THE ORIGINAL FINDING, KEPT BECAUSE THE DIAGNOSIS IS THE USEFUL PART:
// THE PER-CLAIM PATH COULD DRIVE A COHORT'S NET RESERVE NEGATIVE. `newUnpaid += res.retained` sums
// CLAIM-level deltas and nothing bounds that sum by the cohort's own remaining
// reserve, so a register that settles or improves below what the cohort has
// already paid leaves a negative balance. Measured over 40 games x 15 years:
// 0.00% of cohort-valuations with the flag off, 4.03% with the flag on and the
// settlement step suppressed (worst -$17.1M), 7.88% with it live (worst
// -$35.3M). It arrived with the Stage 1 wiring at 42b2c2b; settlement roughly
// doubles it. ibner-null-check cannot see it — that gate runs flag-off, where
// the count is genuinely zero, and simulationEngine's floors note still says the
// crossing is "unreachable", which is true only of the cohort path.
// DO NOT CLAMP IT. A floor on the reserve is precisely the Stage 0 defect that
// note records: it truncates favourable movement one-sidedly and breaks the
// martingale. THE FLAG MUST NOT FLIP UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED.
//
// ⚠ THE MECHANISM IS NOW DIAGNOSED AND IT IS AN AGGREGATION DEFECT, NOT A HOLE
// IN THE RESERVE BASIS. reviseDevelopingSet's call site scales each claim's
// movement by a headroom taken from the PAYOUT PATTERN,
// `cumulativePaid(LINE_PAYOUT_PATTERN[line], c.age + 1)`, while the cohort
// balance those movements land on has been paid down along its own REALISED
// path — and development moves the realised path off the curve. Median headroom
// entering a step: 0.125 pattern against 0.003 realised on cohorts that end the
// step negative, 0.136 against 0.143 on cohorts that do not. A 46x
// overstatement of the balance available to move.
//
// THE CLAIM LEVEL IS SOUND. With settlement suppressed, 100% of negative-reserve
// cohorts have every tracked claim carrying a positive value and 0% were floored
// by cedeDevelopment — the per-claim reserve genuinely cannot go negative, which
// is the whole basis argument and it holds. What is broken is that the cohort
// balance is maintained in parallel with nothing tying it to the register.
// The cohort path cannot do this because `newUnpaid *= factor` MULTIPLIES the
// balance; the per-claim path ADDS deltas computed against a different base.
//
// AND IT IS THE SAME CROSSING STAGE 0 REMOVED, arriving by a different route:
// cumulative netPaid FALLS on 8.9% of cohort year-over-year steps and 815
// cohort-valuations carry an ultimate below their own paid-to-date.
//
// GATED: cohort-ledger-check (FAST) asserts the three ledger identities on BOTH
// arms. It was built RED against the flag-on arm at 85252cc so that the fix
// would turn it green rather than being argued in a report, and it did.
//
// WHAT IS STILL OPEN AND IS NOT CALIBRATION: the size trend is untested where
// it does its work (see its own note and composition-table-check's head), and
// the law's cohort total is unbudgeted against the retired constants — recorded
// below, and a cost for the flip to own rather than a question for Stage 1.
//
// ⚠ `settlement` IS A SECOND ARM, NOT A SECOND FEATURE, AND IT SHIPS TRUE.
// It exists so martingale-equivalence-check can run the engine with the
// settlement step suppressed and read the PERSISTENCE term on its own, then run
// it again with the step live and read the TOTAL. The settlement factor is
// hash-derived and consumes no RNG stream, so the two runs are identical in
// every other respect — a perfect pairing, and the only way to decompose the
// martingale from the engine rather than from a closed form. It has no effect
// whatever while `enabled` is false, because the settlement block never runs.
// ============================================================================
export const PER_CLAIM_REVISION = { enabled: true, settlement: true };
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠ FLIPPED AT THIS COMMIT, AND THE ALLOCATION MACHINERY DID NOT DIE WITH IT.
// The Stage 1 plan inventoried DEVELOPMENT_ALLOCATION, the bench, reselection,
// the spill, the clamp, buildTrackedSet and untrackedTotal as becoming dead at
// the flip. Checked line by line against the engine as it now stands: NONE of
// them is dead, and there are two separate reasons.
//
// 1. THEY ARE NOT FLAG-GATED AT ALL. buildTrackedSet, markDownForBooking and
//    reselectDevelopingSet are gated on DEVELOPMENT_CESSION_ENABLED, not on
//    this flag, and they run identically on both arms. The per-claim law is
//    their CONSUMER, not their replacement — reviseDevelopingSet is called as
//    `reviseDevelopingSet(gameId, live, { untracked, ... })`, where `live` is
//    the tracked set those functions build and `untracked` is the mass they
//    leave behind. Deleting them would remove the law's own inputs.
//
//    allocateDevelopment also survives, because 72b0099 carved the UNWIND out
//    as untouched in both arms: processIbner runs two steps, and only the
//    stochastic one takes the new path. The unwind still calls
//    allocateDevelopment with mode 'proportional', every year, on both arms.
//
// 2. THE ONE GENUINELY FLAG-SPECIFIC PIECE IS THE FLAG-OFF CONTROL.
//    STOCHASTIC_ALLOCATION_MODE is 'developing', and with this flag true the
//    engine never passes it — so on the shipped path allocateDevelopment's
//    'developing' branch and its spill are unreachable. They are still the
//    OFF ARM's stochastic routing, and three diagnostics force this flag false
//    and run the engine as a control: cohort-ledger-check (which ASSERTS all
//    three ledger identities on that arm), pregame-acceptance-check and
//    revision-total-sd-report. Deleting the branch would silently redefine the
//    control those gates compare against — the stochastic step would fall
//    through to 'proportional' and the OFF arm would stop being the cohort
//    mechanism at all.
//
// SO THE MACHINERY BECOMES DELETABLE WHEN THIS FLAG DOES, not when it flips,
// and the flag cannot go while a gate needs the cohort arm as a control. That
// is a real follow-up with a real precondition, not an oversight: retire the
// two-arm gates onto single-arm assertions first, then the flag, then the
// 'developing' mode and STOCHASTIC_ALLOCATION_MODE fall out together.
//
// WHAT WAS RETIRED HERE INSTEAD, both proved green on the new mechanism BEFORE
// deletion rather than on the argument alone: development-sign-symmetry and
// allocation-grid. Their subject was the free-lunch surface created by a
// ROUTING CHOICE, and the per-claim law has no routing choice — every claim's
// delta is its own revision. See scripts/gates.ts for where their coverage
// went and for what is genuinely given up.

// ===========================================================================
// THE PRICING TRIANGLE — S1, FLAG-GATED AND OFF. Nothing in src/ reads it.
//
// Ten accident years, each at its own maturity, claims drawn as an INITIAL
// estimate and developed FORWARD. The mechanism is at claimTriangle.ts; this
// block is the parameter record and the M1 measurement that cleared it.
//
// ⚠ TWO FLAGS, AND THE ORDER BETWEEN THEM IS LOAD-BEARING. A triangle is a
// per-claim object, so its development is the per-claim law — and with
// PER_CLAIM_REVISION off the live engine develops COHORTS and has no per-claim
// development to match. So the factors this triangle teaches become true of the
// played game only once PER_CLAIM_REVISION flips. PER_CLAIM_REVISION must lead
// PRICING_TRIANGLE.
//
// ⚠ THE LEAD CONDITION IS NOW SATISFIED. PER_CLAIM_REVISION flipped at 98ae506
// on feature/payout-patterns and reached this branch by merge, so the triangle's
// development law and the engine's are the same process. That was the
// precondition for S3 and it is the reason S3 could not have been built first.
// ⚠ AND THE PRECONDITION TURNED OUT NOT TO BE SUFFICIENT, WHICH IS WHY THIS
// FLAG DOES NOT GATE claimTriangle.ts ANY MORE. Matching the development
// PROCESS was necessary; the engine also has to PRODUCE development, and a
// mean-one law produces none. The played incurred triangle is flat on every
// line (cumulative 0.9857 / 0.9912 / 1.0005) after the flip exactly as before
// it. So S3 prices off reserveDevelopment — the pool's own played PAID triangle
// — and experienceRating.ts is the consumer. See that file's header for the
// measurements and for why the incurred side cannot be priced off.
// ===========================================================================
// FORWARD BOOKING — the engine books at an INITIAL ESTIMATE and develops up.
//
// ⚠ COMMIT 1 OF THE RATEMAKING LOOP, FLAGGED, AND THE FLAG IS THE ANSWER TO A
// REAL OBJECTION. A half-migrated engine has no measurable intermediate state;
// a flag gives it one. The shipped path keeps working, the migration is
// measured on the flagged arm, and every gate the mechanism breaks is
// registered in EXPECTED_RED BY NAME so later commits turn them green one at a
// time and each of those is itself a measurable state.
//
// WHAT IT CHANGES. A cohort is booked at the sum of its claims' INITIAL
// estimates rather than at its register, and develops forward:
//
//   sum(initial)/sum(drawn)    WC 0.4268    GL 0.2897    Property 0.8056
//
// GL opens at 29% of its register and climbs ~3.5x, against GL's own measured
// cumulative of 3.58. That is the mechanism the played incurred triangle needs:
// today it reads 0.997 / 0.995 / 1.000 and a chain ladder on it returns the
// booked ultimate, so incurred CL is exact by construction and the method
// selection is a puzzle with one answer.
//
// ⚠ E[netUltimate] = registerSum IS NOT DELETED. It moves from a DAY-ONE
// identity to a MATURITY one, and only on the VALUE-WEIGHTED basis — the
// count-weighted reading differs by 40% on GL's alpha-1.3 tail and is not the
// ledger's. See TRIANGLE_INITIAL_CONTRACTION for both columns and for why the
// distinction had to be measured rather than assumed.
//
// ⚠ THE TOWER ATTACHES TO THE BOOKED OCCURRENCE, WHICH IS A RULING AND NOT AN
// ARTEFACT. A real pool does not book a recovery on a claim reserved at $300k;
// it books one when the claim develops past the retention, and cedeDevelopment
// already carries that. Occurrences over the lowest attachment at inception go
// WC 347 -> 93, GL 791 -> 208, Property 333 -> 287, and the recovery arrives
// later through development. That buys something the model did not have:
// RECOVERY LAGS THE LOSS. The alternative — cede on the drawn occurrence while
// booking the contracted one — is a split basis, and this branch has already
// produced six.
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠ RETIREMENT CONDITION, WRITTEN ON DAY ONE.
//
// ratemaking-loop-check asserts the ON arm and stays red until the loop is
// finished. When it passes, this flag has nothing left to gate: remove its
// EXPECTED_RED entry, delete the flag, and make forward booking unconditional.

// THE ORDER, each commit turning named gates green:

// ⚠ WHAT THE FLAGGED ARM BREAKS, MEASURED BY RUNNING THE WHOLE SWEEP WITH THE
// FLAG FORCED ON. 34/50 green, 11 red. Enumerated here BY NAME so commits 2-5

// subject genuinely changed, MIS-SPECIFIED means the gate describes the old
// mechanism and is a later commit's job. None was adjusted to make it pass.
//
//   COMMIT 2 — the ledger and the null tests
//     claims-workbook-check   BROKEN. "Gross Incurred !== Drawn Occurrence" on
//       every developing row. That IS the day-one-to-maturity move: booked gross
//       is now the contracted register and the drawn occurrence is the target it
//       develops towards. The workbook asserts they are equal at every age.
//     audit-formula-check     BROKEN, downstream of the same divergence — 1,600
//       defects and 1,600 hand-check findings, all rows that print a booked
//       figure beside a drawn one.
//     cohort-stock-check      BROKEN, and this one is a real bound rather than a
//       label: WC open cohorts grow 12.7% between year 40 and 60 against a 10%
//       limit, worst age seen 52 against a 60 bound. Forward booking keeps
//       cohorts developing, so they close later and the stock plateaus higher.
//       Needs the horizon to bound it, not the limit widened.
//
//   COMMIT 3 — the tower
//     cession-uplift-basis    BROKEN, and it is ruling 1 working. Lifetime
//       development cession against inception cession reads WC 391.5%, GL 610.0%,
//       Property 162.7% against a 6% limit. The limit encodes a world where
//       cession happened at inception; recovery now lags the loss by design.
//     reinsurance-tower-check BROKEN on one assertion — Property fully declined
//       no longer gives net === gross every year, because development cession
//       arrives after inception.
//     cession-path-independence  NOT A FAILURE — it printed "INCEPTION CESSION IS
//       PATH-INDEPENDENT" and then hit the 30-minute timeout. A runtime casualty
//       of the pre-game cost below, not a mechanism break.
//
//   COMMIT 4 — the opening band, the CLF tables, the reserve margin
//     opening-centring-check  BROKEN. WC's unfiltered candidate median is 2.164
//       against a band midpoint of 1.025 — 292% of the band's width and 58.2 SE;
//       GL 2.469 against 1.510. Reserves fell 58-71%, so opening surplus over
//       premium rose out of its band. RE-SOLVE K, per that gate's own instruction.
//     pregame-acceptance-check BROKEN, and it is the one that matters most: WC
//       exhausts all 500 attempts on 135 of 150 seeds and ships a closest-miss
//       opening, mean attempts 239.59 against a bound of 12. ⚠ THE FLAGGED ARM
//       CANNOT GENERATE A WC PAST TODAY. That is why this flag ships off and why
//       commit 4 cannot be deferred past commit 5.
//     pin-vs-band-check       BROKEN, same root: the pin is now setting the
//       opening because the band no longer filters.
//
//   NOT BREAKS — every seed re-rolls on the flagged arm
//     value-identity-check, solo-export-guard. Both GREEN on the shipped path and
//     verified so at this commit. ⚠ DO NOT RECAPTURE THEM while the flag is off:
//     a recapture taken on the flagged arm would silently move the shipped

// mechanism error."
//
// The divergence was real; its attribution was not. It was not an error in the
// booking law — it was a THREE-YEAR BOOK asked to behave like a mature one.
// Forward booking understates incurred only while a book is YOUNG; a pool in
// runoff equilibrium books incurred equal to ultimate written, because the
// development of its older years offsets the under-booking of its newest. So the
// fix was neither the pin nor the band: it was giving the pool ten accident years
// of runoff (MATURATION_YEARS, in priorHistoryEngine), and the pin was then
// re-solved on top of it — the thing the old paragraph says cannot be done.

//   * that row was already marked invalid — the `age >= horizon` filter meant
//     "finished" only while the horizon WAS the stop, so moving the stop made the
//     filter admit mid-climb cohorts. The horizon-free completion test replaces it.
//
// ⚠ THE OPENBASE READING IN PARTICULAR WAS A DRAW. openBase-only on WC was
// recorded as 0.624 and is 0.790 [0.781, 0.799] — a 27% error, and outside any
// interval the old instrument could have quoted, because it quoted none.
//
// WHAT SURVIVES THE CORRECTION. The DIRECTION of both halves is unchanged and
// each is now resolved rather than indicative: the open base pulls every line
// DOWN (WC 1.014 -> 0.790, GL 1.034 -> 0.652, Property 1.215 -> 0.925) and the
// horizon stop pushes every line UP. They are complementary, as recorded.
//
// WHAT DOES NOT. "It does not explain WC or GL — removing it made both WORSE"
// was read off a deficit that was not there. Commit 1 does not have a WC or GL
// deficit to explain; it has a 2-3% surplus on both and a 22% surplus on
// Property. The analytic two-error model was reported as failing on WC (1.027
// predicted against 0.891 measured) and GL (1.251 against 0.932) — against the
// CORRECTED measurements of 1.026 and 1.019 it is right on WC to three decimals
// and still wrong on GL. That is not a rehabilitation, it is one line agreeing;
// it stays unadopted, but the reason for doubting it has changed.
//
// AND ONE THING THE REVERT DID NOT SETTLE, CORRECTED SEPARATELY: the claim that
// "the tracked set never had the closed-claim error" is wrong. DevelopingClaim
// carries a `closed` FLAG and reselectDevelopingSet stands an occurrence down
// while keeping its place in the register (developmentAllocation.ts:595), so a
// closed tracked occurrence is still in `live`. The error is in BOTH bases.
//
// THE REMAINING CAUSE, still not confirmed: the generator compounds drift PER
// CLAIM to that claim's own closure age, while this engine applies it PER COHORT
// VALUATION bounded by IBNER_HORIZON (WC 5-12, GL 3-8, Property 2-4). Different
// clocks. Property's horizon is short but sits where 2/(age+1) is largest, which
// is consistent with its 22%. Confirm before fixing — do not tune the drift
// constants to close the gap, which would fit the symptom.

// Forward booking marks each new cohort DOWN to a contracted initial estimate —
// measured at ~53% of gross ultimate on WC, which is what booking at 1/2.33 of

//
// ⚠ ON WC, LATE IN THE GAME, THE DISTORTION TRACKS GROWTH AND THE SPREAD IS
// 4.5x: a growing book still understates incurred by 13.9% of ultimate while a
// shrinking one has come down to 3.1%. A pool that grows looks materially more
// profitable than it is, and the player is not told.
//
// ⚠ ON GL IT IS MASKED BY A LARGER LINE EFFECT AND MUST NOT BE READ THE SAME
// WAY. GL's distortion RISES late on every arm (33.0-36.5% at years 10+,
// against WC's 3.1-14.7%) and the spread across tiers is only 3.5pp. Whatever
// drives GL's late distortion is bigger than growth and is not this. Reporting
// a growth effect on GL from these numbers would be reading noise.
//
// ⚠ AND THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT THIS MEASUREMENT WAS WRONG, WHICH IS WHY IT IS
// STATED BY LINE. Banding by year-on-year growth rate WITHIN one arm showed no
// relationship at all (16-24% across every band, unordered) because a single
// trajectory does not span enough book-age variation to separate the effect
// from noise. The tiers span it; the growth bands did not.
//
// NOT FIXED HERE. The honest fix is a booking basis that does not depend on the

//
// Solved by bisection on the VALUE-WEIGHTED mean cumulative over real registers,
// each claim at its own closure age and each cohort at a horizon drawn from its
// line's own range. The cumulative is preserved to four decimals on every line,
// so TRIANGLE_INITIAL_CONTRACTION does not move: c is set by the severity
// anchor and the anchor does not care about timing.
//
// ⚠ WHY THE HORIZON IS THE RIGHT WINDOW, AND IT IS ANCHORED ON ONE LINE. GL's
// own factor series runs 1.872 / 1.439 / 1.265 / 1.031 / 1.024 — model ages 1-3
// carry 3.405 of a 4.000 cumulative, 87% of it, against a horizon of 3-8. So
// stopping at the horizon truncates nothing that matters, and spreading the
// development out to a closure age of 10 would make the model FLATTER than the
// source rather than more faithful. It also avoids lengthening cohort life,
// which cohort-stock-check is already red on.
//
// ⚠ WC AND PROPERTY INHERIT THE SHAPE AND HAVE NO SERIES OF THEIR OWN. Their
// horizons are 5-12 and 2-4 and neither has a factor series to check against, so
// they carry GL's argument at the same standing the drift constants already do —
// a judgement wearing an anchor's clothes. Recorded rather than implied.
//
// ⚠ AND THE GENERATOR HAS NOT BEEN RE-SOLVED TO MATCH. claimTriangle.ts still
// drifts to CLOSURE age, so its cumulative agrees with the engine's by
// construction but its AGE-TO-AGE shape does not — the engine compresses the
// same climb into a shorter window. Nothing consumes the generator's factors for
// pricing today (triangle-check is its only reader), so this is bounded; it MUST
// be closed before the ten-year seed lands, or the seed teaches factors the
// played game does not reproduce, which is the defect this whole sequence
// exists to remove.
// ============================================================================
// ⚠⚠ WIRED, MEASURED, AND REVERTED. THE SOLVE BELOW IS WRONG IN DIRECTION ON
// ALL THREE LINES. DO NOT WIRE IT. The claim two paragraphs down that "the solve
// below is correct and stands" is RETRACTED — it was never tested against the
// engine, only against its own derivation.
//
// It was wired at the maturity-anchor commit (engineDevelopmentDrift, reading
// this constant, replacing developmentDrift at the cohort revision call) and
// measured on maturity-anchor-check. The gross climb against 1/c, value-weighted,
// cohorts with room for the longest horizon:
//
//   line        with g (shipped)   with g' (this constant)
//   WC              +3.3%                  +31.4%
//   GL             +26.4%                  +42.8%
//   Property       +35.1%                  +45.1%
//
// Worse on every line. Reverted the same session; src/ is code-identical to
// 9f0756a and only this record was kept.
//
// ⚠ WHY IT FAILS, AND THE REASONING ERROR IS ONE SENTENCE IN THIS BLOCK. The
// solve's stated premise is "same target, SHORTER window, therefore a HIGHER
// rate". The engine's effective window is LONGER, not shorter, on every line —
// and on WC that is true even though its mean horizon (8.5) is below its
// value-weighted closure age (10.8). The reason is that the two objects are not
// both "a window":
//
//     generator   value-weighted MEAN OVER CLAIMS of prod to that claim's own
//                 closure — so the many claims that close at age 1-2 contribute
//                 a cumulative of 1.0 and drag the mean down
//     engine      prod over the FULL cohort horizon, applied to the whole cohort
//                 value including the value of claims that closed in year one
//
// The drift is front-loaded (2/(age+1)), so most of the cumulative is earned in
// the first few steps — exactly the steps the early-closing claims should not
// receive and the engine gives them anyway. Measured, same g:
//
//   line      1/c      value-wtd cum to closure   E[cum to horizon]
//   WC       2.3813            2.4656                  2.5013

//   Property 1.2258            1.2498                  1.6672
//
// The middle column is what g was solved for and it lands (+3.5% / -6.2% /
// +2.0%). The right column is what the engine realises. The gap is the clock,
// and no re-solve of a single per-step rate in the UPWARD direction can close it.
//
// ⚠ WHAT WOULD LAND, DIAGNOSTIC ONLY AND DELIBERATELY NOT ADOPTED. Bisecting for
// the rate that makes E[cum to horizon] equal 1/c gives WC 0.24848, GL 0.47068,
// Property 0.09875 — BELOW g on every line, against this constant's values which
// are above it. Property's would fall 62%. These are not written into the
// codebase and should not be: a rate solved to make a cohort-level compounding
// hit a claim-level target is fitting the symptom, which is the objection this
// block already raises about tuning the drift constants. The defect is that the
// engine has no per-claim clock; the fix belongs at the clock, not at the rate.

//
// ⚠ NEITHER HALF SHIPS ALONE AND THAT IS STRUCTURAL. The rate below is solved
// on the assumption that a claim STOPS drifting when it closes — the solve
// compounds over min(closure, horizon). Without the open base the drift reaches
// every occurrence for the whole horizon, so raising the rate simply
// over-develops: horizonStop alone reads 1.18 / 1.31 / 1.28. They are
// complementary by construction.
//
// ⚠ WHY openBase MISSED, MEASURED. The tracked mask is right. The UNTRACKED
// share was approximated as `1 - closedShare(resolveClosureCurve(line, 0), age+2)`
// and that proxy is 3x to 1000x too small, because the smallest SIZE BAND closes
// far faster than the untracked mix (which runs up to the retention) and the +2
// convention compounds it:
//
//   proxy / true open share    age 1    age 3    age 8
//   WC                         0.285    0.178    0.063
//   GL                         0.189    0.034    0.001
//   Property                   0.257    0.264    0.343
//
// So openBase suppressed almost all untracked drift rather than the closed part
// of it. THE FIX IS NOT A BETTER GUESS AT THE BAND: the untracked open share is
// a value-weighted property of each line's untracked SIZE MIX and has to be
// derived per line as a curve, the same way the payout and closure curves are.
// Until it is, this constant has no correct consumer.
//
// ⚠ AND THE ACCEPTANCE SAMPLE WAS TOO SMALL TO STEER BY EITHER — n=3 finished
// WC cohorts in 12 games x 20 years, because the completion test is strict and
// WC's horizon is 5-12.
//
// RESOLVED, and not by loosening the completion test. A cohort's ratio TO DATE is
// measured against the development it SHOULD have received by that age, so every
// accident year contributes at every age instead of only the finished ones —
// 22,800 WC observations at 120 games where the old test found 196 rows. The two
// statistics agree to within 0.7-4.0% ON THE SAME COHORTS and disagree across
// their populations, because "finished" selects on closure speed. See

//     "PRICING_TRIANGLE ALONE IS A CONFIGURATION NOTHING HAS MEASURED" was the
//     objection. FORWARD_BOOKING shipped at the maturation-book commit, so both
//     flags on IS the shipped configuration and the arms that always ran them
//     together now run what the game runs. Property's over-development closed
//     with the open-share curve: maturity-anchor-check reads +7.2% against a 10%
//     bound.
//
//   THE FUNDING SLIDER IS MISLABELLED — FIXED, AND NOT BY FIXING THE TABLES.
//     clf-label-backtest-check was red at 14.7pp on GL. It is GREEN: worst label
//     error -3.2pp against a 5pp tolerance, on 960 line-years per line, with no
//     table re-derived and GL still reading GL_SUPPLIED. The tables were never
//     the defect — a three-year book under a mean-one law put realised
//     confidence a long way from its label, and ten accident years of runoff
//     under forward booking put it back. The two errors this paragraph feared
//     stacking are down to one, and it is inside tolerance.
//
//   IT COSTS SURPLUS — STILL A DESIGN CALL, BUT THE PRICE IS A TENTH OF WHAT
//     THIS SAID. The figures above (median 2.068 against 3.081) were measured on
//     the three-year bootstrap, which no longer exists. Re-measured on the mature
//     book, 50 games x 10 years, funding at Expected, investments OFF — the arm
//     the objection rested on:

//       below opening    58% -> 48%          ever insolvent  2% -> 0%
//
//     ⚠ AND BOTH HALVES OF THE OLD DIAGNOSIS EVAPORATED. Leverage — charge over
//     opening surplus — was 1.66x against 0.81x and is now 1.62x against 1.62x,
//     IDENTICAL: that gap was the three-year bootstrap accumulating before the
//     player started, and the mature book closed it. The combined-ratio spread
//     was 15.0pt halving to 7.1pt and is now 16.1pt going to 17.6pt, slightly
//     WIDER. So the downside compression that remains is explained by neither
//     statistic, and the insolvency gap it was argued from is 2% against 0% —
//     ONE GAME IN FIFTY, which carries no weight. What is left is a lifted
//     bottom decile and nothing else moving.

// close to the boundary. Carrying GL across would have been conservative rather

// it leaned.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THE REBUILD ACTUALLY WANTS IS STILL FURTHER AWAY, AND THIS IS THE OPEN
// ITEM. The source's own first-estimate-to-settled spread is 1.48-1.96. At these
// terminal targets that implies development of 1.410-0.580 on WC and 1.546-0.859
// on GL, against the model's 0.620 and 0.714 today — so phi would have to rise
// substantially. AND PROPERTY CANNOT REACH THE TOP OF THAT RANGE AT ALL: at a
// terminal of 1.636, an initial of 1.96 is a NEGATIVE residual. Property's
// terminal is too narrow to hold the source's first-estimate spread, and that is
// a real constraint on S2 rather than a rounding problem. Recorded now because
// S1 is where it becomes visible and S2 is where it has to be answered.

// ⚠ WHICH STATISTIC THESE PRESERVE, MEASURED, BECAUSE THE ENGINE NEEDS A
// DIFFERENT ONE FROM THE TRIANGLE AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ON A PARETO TAIL.
//
// A triangle read as a LOSS COST needs the mean over CLAIMS preserved. An

// GL (alpha 1.3) those diverge by 40%+, so the question had to be measured

//
//   WC 0.4268     GL 0.2897     Property 0.8056
//
// So a GL cohort would open at 29% of its register and develop up ~3.5x, which
// is GL's own cumulative of 3.58. That is the mechanism the ratemaking loop's
// condition 3 needs and it is correctly anchored — but it re-levels reserves,
// and it moves claims across the tower's lowest attachment at inception
// (occurrences over $1M: WC 347 -> 93, GL 791 -> 208, Property 333 -> 287), so
// the tower, the CLF tables, the opening band and the reserve margin all follow

//
// ⚠ GL'S A WAS RE-SOLVED 2.156982 -> 2.295852, +6.44%, AND IT IS A REPRICING
// RATHER THAN A RESERVE CORRECTION. The mean-preservation identity — a claim
// developed to its terminal must average 1.000 of the value drawn — read 0.9395
// on GL at 30 seed families. Six percent low, which means a triangle read as a
// loss cost understated by that much.
//
// ⚠ IT WAS A BIAS AND THE SHIPPED SAMPLE WAS HIDING IT. triangle-check defaulted
// to 6 families; raising it moved GL AWAY from 1.000 rather than toward it
// (0.9608 at 6, 0.9395 at 30), which is what distinguishes a bias from noise.
// Identical at d1cef12 and after the WC volatility work, so nothing recent
// caused it.
//
// ⚠ THE DEFECT IS IN THE STARTING POINT, NOT THE CLIMB, AND THE TWO STATISTICS
// SEPARATE CLEANLY. The terminal is cumulativeDevelopment(closureAge) x
// claimTerminalValue(A x drawn^k, ...), so it is EXACTLY PROPORTIONAL TO A.
// Therefore sd(ln terminal) is INVARIANT to A — sd(ln(A x)) = sd(ln x) — and
// the spread statistic measures k and the climb alone. GL PASSES the spread
// (2.1369 against a 2.140 target) and FAILS the mean. A climb defect would have
// moved both. So one constant is the whole fix, the solve is exact rather than
// iterative, and triangle-check's SOLVE mode verifies it: re-measured at the
// solved A, the ratio reads 1.0000.
//
// ⚠ GL'S RATE READS THIS, WHICH IS WHY IT IS A REPRICING. Established by

// The channel is S3: currentPurePremiumPer100 takes an ExperienceBasis — "the

// FORWARD_BOOKING nor initialEstimate).
//
// ⚠ WC HAS THE SAME DEFECT, SMALLER, ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND IS DELIBERATELY NOT
// TOUCHED HERE. Its ratio reads 1.0336 at 30 families — implied A 1.457474, a
// -3.25% move — inside the 0.05 tolerance but not centred. It was 1.0259 before
// WC gained its shared year factor and 1.0336 after, so most of it predates that
// change. Property is effectively exact at 0.9971 (implied +0.29%). This commit
// re-solves GL because that is what was ruled; WC's number is recorded so the
// next person does not have to re-derive it.
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ k WAS ASKED TO BE FLATTENED AND IT IS NOT FLATTENED. THE MEASUREMENT SAID
// SOMETHING WORSE THAN THE DEFECT IT WAS SENT TO FIX. NOTHING BELOW MOVED.
//
// THE REQUEST, AND IT IS A FAIR ONE. Because booked = A x drawn^k with k < 1,
// the contraction is size-dependent: at the shipped constants a $50k claim
// books at 48.3% of drawn and a $125M claim at 15.7%, a 3.08x spread. Nothing

// asserts sd(ln terminal) within 0.08 of 2.140, and sd(ln(A x)) = sd(ln x), so
// A is invariant to it BY CONSTRUCTION. The spread is k's alone. k = 0.88 is the
// largest value that still passes (off by 0.046, 58% of the tolerance, and it
// only takes the booking spread 3.08x -> 2.56x). k >= 0.90 fails. So the
// flattening that would be worth having is exactly the flattening the gate
// forbids, and the gate is not wrong — see the next paragraph.
//
// ⚠ WHY: k IS NOT A BOOKING LAW, IT IS VARIANCE MATCHING, AND THAT IS THE REAL
// FINDING. sd(ln DRAWN) measures 2.1632 on the same sample, so the 2.140 target
// is the drawn distribution's own log-spread and asserting it is right. The
// development walk injects its own noise: sd(ln(terminal/drawn)) = 0.82 — a
// factor of 2.28 either way at ONE standard deviation — and that figure is the
// SAME at k = 0.856 and at k = 1, so it is the walk's, not the contraction's.
// The arithmetic closes: sqrt((0.856 x 2.1632)^2 + 0.82^2) = 2.03 against a
// measured 2.14, and at k = 1, sqrt(2.1632^2 + 0.82^2) = 2.31 against 2.43.
// k is compressing the true signal to make room for the walk's noise so that
// the TOTAL lands on the drawn spread. The size-dependent under-booking is the
// price of that compression.
//
// ⚠ SO THE TERMINAL IS NOT THE CLAIM'S ULTIMATE. IT IS A RANDOM MULTIPLE OF IT.
// At the shipped k the per-claim ratio runs p10 0.449, p50 1.195, p90 3.639; at
// k = 1 it runs p10 0.179, p50 0.461, p90 1.422. Both gates pass in both
// configurations because both are AGGREGATE statistics and the per-claim errors
// offset. Neither configuration tracks an individual claim at all.
//
// ⚠ THE ORDER, SINCE IT WAS ASKED: k LEADS AND A FOLLOWS, IN ONE EXACT PASS.
// They cannot be solved together and do not need to be. The terminal is exactly
// proportional to A, so A_solved = A / ratio is closed-form given k, and the
// spread is invariant to A. k changes the shape; A rescales it. Solving them
// jointly would be solving a triangular system as though it were coupled.
//
// WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY FIX IT, in order: reduce the walk's residual dispersion so
// the terminal converges on the drawn value instead of scattering by a factor of
// 2.3, THEN set k = 1 and re-solve A. At that point the booking law is flat, the
// per-band bias is gone and the spread lands without compensation. Moving k
// first buys 3.08x -> 2.56x, spends most of the spread tolerance, leaves the
// >$25M band at 0.673 instead of 0.617, and has to move again afterwards.

//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠ GL IS MEASURED. WC AND PROPERTY ARE JUDGEMENT. Do not read the three as

//
// GL's target cumulative of 3.60 is the pool's own age-to-age factors multiplied
// out: 1.872 x 1.439 x 1.265 x 1.031 x 1.024. 85% of that development sits in

//
// WC 2.50 and Property 1.25 have NO source behind them. Neither transfer rule
// from GL works and both were measured before being rejected: the same annual
// rate gives WC a cumulative of 8.8 and Property 1.65; the same cumulative needs
// g of 34.9% on WC and 138% on Property. Either is a judgement wearing an
// anchor's clothes, so these are stated as judgement instead — the same standing
// as IBNER_TOTAL_SD's 25/20/15%, phi's carry-across to two lines with no settled
// severity of their own, and the headroom exponent chosen on GL evidence. The
// reasoning is ordinary domain judgement: WC is long-tailed but its early
// development is less explosive than liability, and Property settles most of its
// book within three years.
//
// WHAT WOULD DISPLACE THEM: those two lines' own age-to-age triangles. One
// extract each, and they stop being judgement.
//
// ===========================================================================
// ⚠ AND THE WINDOW TAIL IS WC's ALONE, WHICH IS NOT WHAT THE DESIGN ASSUMED.
// The point of a ten-year window is that development continues past it, so the
// correct tail factor is unknown and has to be selected. Measured from each
// line's own fitted closure curve, value-weighted open share at age 10:
//
//   WC 43.6%      GL 0.1%      Property 0.1%
//
// So GL and Property have essentially nothing open past the window and NO drift
// of any size reaches beyond it — their tail factors run 1.0001 to 1.027 across
// the whole plausible range of g. Only WC gets a structural window error, and at
// its shipped drift that is about 17% — a CHOSEN number, since WC's g is
// judgement, not a measured one.
//
// This is not a defect to fix here. It means the SELECTION error carries GL and
// Property rather than supplementing them, which is S5's job and now its whole

// tail error as applying to all three.
//
// ⚠ LENGTHENING IBNER_HORIZON WOULD DO NOTHING, and this was checked rather than

// error at this sample, so the honest reading is no measurable change rather
// than a small one.
//
// ⚠ THE CONDITION THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THIS IS WITHDRAWN, AND THE REASONING
// BEHIND IT WAS WRONG TWICE OVER. It read: the law does not widen the pre-game
// because its realised movement (9.8% of cohort incurred at age 1) is smaller
// than the cohort path it replaces (IBNER_TOTAL_SD 20-25%), so if the 84%/9.8%
// work raises that movement the band question reopens.
//
// THOSE WERE DIFFERENT STATISTICS. 9.8% is PER STEP. IBNER_TOTAL_SD is the TOTAL
// relative SD of the ultimate over the whole runoff, by its own definition at
// reserveStepSigma. Increments add in variance, so 9.8% over five or six steps
// is 21.9% to 24.0% — the same neighbourhood, not a third of it.
//
// AND THE DIRECTION WAS BACKWARDS. Measured on the constant's own basis
// (revision-total-sd-report: pre-cession cohort development at maturity, sample
// unbiased in the horizon draw), the law develops 2.7x to 3.2x the cohort path
// on the robust spread — MORE, not less, on every line.
//
// So the band clearance above is unconditional, and for a better reason than
// the one it had. The ON arm measured here IS that widened mechanism at the
// same phi: the pre-game already contains the widening and the opening
// distribution did not move. A 3-year pre-game takes two or three steps of a
// five-to-twelve-step runoff, at the low-age end where s is smallest, and the
// opening surplus ratio is set by premium and loss LEVEL rather than by cohort
// development tails. The band met the widening and survived it.
//
// ⚠ THE 84%-VERSUS-9.8% ITEM IS CLOSED. Its answer is at
// CLAIM_MOVEMENT_BY_AGE_TARGET and it is that the target is not a target. What
// follows is what the chase established, kept because each step was wrong in a
// way a future reader could repeat.
//
// THE COMPOSITION AND THE TARGET NEVER MET. With the ages aligned (see the
// retraction at CLAIM_OPEN_SHARE_MODEL_RECORDED) the composition tracks as
// briefed — count-weighted magnitude x leaving open share gives 84 / 50 / 30 /
// 17 / 8 against 110 / 65 / 42 / 17 / 6 — and that agreement carried no
// information about the target, because the two constrain DISJOINT HALVES of
// the min(age, size) combine. At GL model age 1 the size trend binds on 14.3%
// of claims by count and 95.9% by value: the count-weighted composition is
// measuring the AGE CURVE with the size trend inactive, and the value-weighted
// target is measuring the SIZE TREND with the age curve inactive. A gate that
// validates one says nothing about the other.
//
// THE DECOMPOSITION, WHICH CLOSES EXACTLY. Composed 0.829 to realised 0.111 at
// GL age 1 is four multiplicative terms and the ladder reproduces the realised
// figure to three decimals at every age on every line:
//   weighting basis, count against value   /2.88   53% of the log gap
//   phi = 0.63                             /1.59   23%
//   q = 0.70                               /1.43   18%
//   E|f-1| / s = 0.799                     /1.25   11%
//   open-share timing                      x1.10   -5%
// phi and q are not defects — they are terms the composition never contained.
//
// ⚠ AND THE MEAN-ONE CORRECTION WAS THE SMALLEST TERM, WHICH REFUTED THE
// HYPOTHESIS IT WAS BUILT TO TEST. exp(-s^2/2) was the natural suspect: one
// parameter doing two jobs, a median that collapses as s grows. It accounts for
// 11% of the gap and, at the ages the target lives on, essentially none of it —
// E|X-1|/s tends to sqrt(2/pi) = 0.798 for ANY log-symmetric factor as s -> 0,
// and GL age 1 measures 0.799. The correction only bites where s is large,
// which on GL is age 5 (0.763) and on Property is age 5 (0.258). It is a real
// property of the factor and it is not the movement gap.
//
// ⚠ AND THE SECOND OPEN ITEM, WHICH IS LARGER THAN THE FIRST: THE LAW'S COHORT
// TOTAL IS UNBUDGETED. Measured on IBNER_TOTAL_SD's own basis
// (revision-total-sd-report), the law develops 2.7x to 3.2x the cohort path it
// replaces on the robust spread. Two things follow and both belong to the flip.
//
//   THE SD IS NOT ESTIMABLE ON THE ON ARM. WC's sample SD read 31% at 40 games
//   and 83% at 100, because one cohort at 22x its register sum sets it. That is
//   reserveStepSigma's own warning from the other side — its header records a
//   Monte Carlo still climbing toward the closed form at 48M trials. "Does the
//   law deliver IBNER_TOTAL_SD" cannot be answered by measuring an SD.
//
//   s IS UNBOUNDED, AND THAT WAS THE PROXIMATE CAUSE. Under s = phi x magnitude
//   / headroom nothing bounded the division: as a cohort pays down, headroom
//   goes to zero. At the median tracked occurrence GL reached s = 22.75 by age 8
//   and Property s = 3.80 by age 4. The magnitude was fitted on the INCURRED and
//   the division is what puts it on the reserve, so nothing fitted ever chose
//   those values. At large s the factor is still exactly mean-one but delivers
//   it as a near-certain collapse plus a vanishing chance of an enormous
//   multiple. WC's tail is the other shape: s stays near 1 and twelve steps
//   compound it.
//   ⚠ s IS STILL UNBOUNDED AND THE TAIL IS STILL SHUT — BOTH, AND THIS PARAGRAPH
//   STAYS AS WRITTEN BECAUSE ITS DIAGNOSIS WAS ONLY HALF RIGHT. h^-0.5 diverges
//   too, and the same table now reads GL 1.84 and Property 1.01 only because it
//   uses the PATTERN's headroom; the engine uses the realised balance and goes
//   lower. What actually removed the tail is that the delta stopped cancelling
//   the divisor — movement goes as sqrt(h), so a large s now arrives where the
//   balance it multiplies is vanishing. So "s is unbounded" was never the
//   mechanism on its own, and clamping s would not have been the fix. See
//   CLAIM_REVISION_HEADROOM_EXPONENT.
//
// THIS DOES NOT CONTRADICT THE TERMINAL-SEVERITY ANCHOR. That anchor constrains
// the log-SD of SETTLED severity PER CLAIM; this is the COHORT aggregate. The
// old path drew one lognormal per accident year with a mixture that made half
// of them nearly flat, while the law draws every occurrence separately and a
// cohort's movement is then dominated by its few largest with almost no
// diversification. Matching the one and widening the other are consistent —
// which is exactly why this quantity went unbudgeted until it was measured.
//
// WHAT IS BUILT AND GREEN: terminal-severity-check (FAST, 30s) derives phi
// against the anchor and carries the phi = 0 control arm;
// revision-direction-check (FAST, 5s) asserts the probe arm out of
// reviseDevelopingSet; martingale-equivalence-check (SLOW) decomposes the
// persistence and settlement terms with separate intervals and carries the
// fitted-level control arm, which reads 0.837 against a 1% tolerance. At the
// shipped exponent it measures persistence 1.00034 +/- 0.00022, settlement
// 1.00099 +/- 0.00174, total 1.00130 +/- 0.00172 over 49.4M claim-walks, with
// the engine arm agreeing on h to 1.7e-15 within cohort.
//
// ⚠ AND ONE THING THAT WAS NOT GREEN AND NOTHING CAUGHT: revision-total-sd-report
// kept its own inlined copy of s with the headroom division hardcoded, so for a
// whole commit it printed the RETIRED form's s table under a heading describing
// the shipped one, with a paragraph of prose reasoning from those numbers. It is
// now routed through revisionSigma, which exists for that reason. A report that
// recomputes the law cannot disagree with the law, so no gate could have found
// this — only reading it could.

//   ⚠ 40% OF AMOUNTS ARE ROUND-NUMBER CASE RESERVES, so the body carries spikes

//   WHAT IT WAS. One observed event in ten years — $550M of loss on $111.1B of

//   CHOSEN RETURN PERIOD, never a fit, and tagged ASSERTED throughout.
//
//   WHY IT CAME OUT. The intent was that shock events REALISE the load rather
//   than add to it, the same structure as GL's social-inflation baseline with
//   event #19 on top. But Property's cat shock is gated off and the aggregate
//   shock add-on that used to reach Property left with the Gamma path, so
//   Property collected the load every year and COULD NOT INCUR IT — a 20.4%

//   would have measured a Property collecting 0.1209 and losing 0.0962 —
//   reading ~80% of premium every year with no variance contributed by the

// THE PROPERTY CATASTROPHE BAND — one regional event process, priced exactly.
//
// THE MECHANISM. Events arrive Poisson(eventsPerYear) per year. Each event
// strikes ONE region, drawn with regionWeights. Every enrolled member in that
// region is hit independently with probability `footprint`, and a hit member
// loses damageRatio x primaryAssetShare x TIV — a FIXED amount per member, the
// same every time that member is hit. All of an event's claims are ONE
// OCCURRENCE: the tower sees their sum.
//
// ⚠ ONE OCCURRENCE PER REGION. An event is one region by construction; a
// wildfire that crosses two regions is two events, two occurrences, and two
// retentions — $10M at Property's $5M. That is the ruling, not an
// approximation of a spanning event.
//
// WHY THE LOSS IS FIXED PER MEMBER, AND NOT DRAWN. With a fixed loss the only
// randomness inside an event is which region is struck and which members are
// hit, so each member is a TWO-POINT variable {0 w.p. 1-f, L_i w.p. f} and the
// event loss distribution is EXACT: convolve a region's members, mix over the
// three regions. propertyCatastrophe.ts builds it that way and nothing on the
// pricing path samples. A drawn damage ratio would still be exact (more points
// per member); a shared event intensity scaling every member would not.
//
// ALL PARAMETERS FIXED BY RULING, NONE TUNED HERE:
//   footprint    0.075   share of a struck region's members that are hit
//   budget       12%     cat share of TOTAL expected loss on the calibration
//                        book — the target eventsPerYear is solved against
//
// ⚠ NO RETENTION AND NO CEILING OF ITS OWN ANY MORE. A cat occurrence meets
// Property's one tower like any other occurrence — $5M retained, covered to a
// $1B top (REINSURANCE_TOWER.Property, PROPERTY_TOWER_TOP). The $37.5M cat
// retention and $500M cat ceiling that stood here were invented levers and
// came out with the separate cat layer. The retention stays FLAT per
// occurrence, which keeps the retained distribution exact: a
// percentage-of-affected-TIV form would need a two-dimensional lattice.
//
// ⚠ eventsPerYear AND regionWeights ARE PROPERTIES OF THE MARKET, NOT OF THE
// ENROLLED BOOK. Both were derived once on the 200-member canonical roster and
// are held, like every other calibrated constant here — and they have to be:
// a region's chance of being struck that depended on who had enrolled would
// make one member's cat losses move with another member's enrolment decision,
// which is the coupling enrolment-independence-check exists to forbid.
//   regionWeights   the roster's TIV share by region, to 4 dp (asserted)
//   eventsPerYear   catAAL / E[event gross] on the full roster at neutral RQ,
//                   catAAL = 0.12/0.88 x E[attritional]: $16.96M / $201.63M
//                   = 0.084117, held at 0.08412 (asserted)
// So the 12% budget holds EXACTLY on the full market and only there. An
// enrolled book's realised share moves with its region mix and its members'
// primaryAssetShare. That is a real property of the book, so it is measured
// rather than forced.
//
// WHAT IS NOT APPLIED TO A CAT CLAIM, deliberately:
//   - severityCap. The $75M cap disciplines the FITTED mixture's second
//     moment; a cat claim is bounded by the member's own TIV, not by it.
//   - kPr and risk quality. The cat loss has no RQ term, so there is nothing

// ⚠ A PLACEHOLDER. NOBODY SOURCED THIS FIGURE: 10% OF DRAWN CATASTROPHES ARE
// EARTHQUAKES.
//
// A drawn catastrophe is an earthquake or it is not — two categories, not the
// retired design doc's three perils. Earthquake is the only peril anything
// downstream treats differently: it retains PROPERTY_PERIL_DEDUCTIBLE's $10M
// rather than the layer's $5M. Flood and wildfire would be labels nothing reads.
//
// THE SHARE WAS CHOSEN, NOT DERIVED. The real book says only that earthquakes
// are "really rare" and has no figure to hand. 10% was picked to be rare without
// being nil. It is not an event-frequency study, a hazard-model output or a
// loss-history share, and it should not be quoted as one.
//
// HOW IT ENTERS. Each drawn event is an earthquake with this probability,
// independent of its region and of its size (stream `pr_cat_peril`, one uniform
// per event, so no other draw moves). Being independent of size is what keeps
// the pricing exact: the earthquakes are a thinning of the same Poisson event
// process, so the per-event cession is a MIXTURE of the one event distribution
// read at two attachments — see catEventRetained. It is a deductible, not a
// rate: earthquake sits inside the catastrophe charge, as in the real
// programme, and gets no rate element of its own.
//
// ⚠ IT SAYS SO HERE BECAUSE FOUR UNSOURCED CONSTANTS WENT WRONG IN ONE WEEK.
// This one is labelled before it ships rather than after.
//
// WHAT WOULD REPLACE IT: the programme's earthquake share of catastrophe
// frequency or AAL, from the real book's cat model output or its loss history,
// by region if the book has it. A regional figure would also need the
// earthquake's own region weights, which the pricing can take as a third
// mixture weight without losing exactness.
//
// MEASURED BESIDE IT — share 0 against 10%, year 1, layer placed:
//
//                                  tower price              per $100k TIV
//   full 200-member market         $91.035M -> $90.927M      153.69 -> 153.51
//   game books (8 seeds, enrolled) -$0.074M a year mean      -0.42
//   Property total member charge   -0.11% (game books, year 1)
//
// SMALL, AND IT HAS TO BE. The most an earthquake can take off the layer is
// $5M (the band between the attachment and the deductible), arriving at
// 0.08412 x 10% = 0.0084 a year: at most $42k of expected cession, plus its
// share of the risk load. The price falls every year, earthquake or not, but
// by about a tenth of a percent of the member charge.
//
// AND THE EVENT ITSELF IS RARE: one drawn earthquake in ~119 years.
// P(at least one) is 4.1% in a 5-year game and 8.1% in a 10-year one. A
// scheduled #2 is the way a game reliably meets one.

// THE OPEN-SHARE CURVE — the share of a cohort's VALUE still able to develop,
// by step age. Derived by scripts/diagnostics/open-share-derive.ts.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT FIXES. Forward booking drifts a cohort's WHOLE value once a year,
// so a claim that closed at age 1 keeps receiving development — and the drift
// is front-loaded at 2/(age+1), so those are the largest steps. That is the
// clock mismatch behind BOTH open symptoms: a crossing age profile against
// T(a), and a terminal overshoot against 1/c of +26.4% on GL and +35.1% on
// Property. Scaling each step by this curve gives the cohort a per-claim clock
// with no per-claim state, which is the constraint that killed the alternatives.
//
// ⚠ IT IS AN IDENTITY, NOT AN APPROXIMATION, AND THE DERIVER ASSERTS IT:
//     V(a) = V(a-1) . (1 + g . 2/(a+1) . s_a) = V(a-1) + g . 2/(a+1) . (open value)
// which is exactly the sum of the per-claim steps over the open claims.
// Measured, cohort compounding against per-claim mean-of-products: 0.9966 /
// 1.0000 / 1.0000.
//
// ⚠ INDEXED BY STEP, NOT BY AGE. s[a-1] applies to STEP a, which carries value
// from age a-1 to age a. It is weighted on value AT AGE a-1 and a claim takes
// that step iff its closure age exceeds a. Pairing a step with the share at its
// LANDING age instead under-corrects by 10-27%; that was got wrong once.
//
// ⚠ AND WEIGHTED ON DRIFTED VALUE, NOT ON THE OPENING. A claim still open at
// age 5 has drifted for five steps and carries more weight than its booked
// value implies.
//
// ⚠ NOT resolveClosureCurve(line, 0), WHICH WAS TRIED AND IS 3x TO 1000x TOO
// SMALL. That picks the smallest SIZE BAND while the untracked mix runs to the
// retention. Proxy / true open share when it was tried at 1a: WC 0.285 / 0.178
// / 0.063 at ages 1 / 3 / 8, GL 0.189 / 0.034 / 0.001, Property 0.257 / 0.264 /
// 0.343. The curve must be derived over each line's own size mix.
