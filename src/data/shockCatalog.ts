// THE SHOCK EVENT TABLE.
//
// Events are DATA. Adding event #23 is adding a row here — no new function, no
// new branch in the engine. The machinery lives in src/utils/shockResolver.ts
// and the effect vocabulary in src/types/shocks.ts.
//
// IDs are the design-matrix numbers so the table and the matrix stay mapped to
// each other — except WILDFIRE and WATER-CONTAMINATION, whose matrix numbers
// are not in the repository and which carry provisional names (see their
// rows). Eight of the ~40 events are present, and all eight are executable:
// #2 was data only until the Property cat band gave it something to force.
//
// EVERY MAGNITUDE HERE IS PROVISIONAL AND CALIBRATION IS DEFERRED. These are
// sized to their stated MECHANISM, never tuned to make the game feel risky. The
// pool currently cannot lose money at default decisions (0 of 50 five-year games
// ended below starting surplus, finding 24), and that is being fixed on the
// economics side. Shocks must be calibrated against a pool that already has
// two-sided risk — tuning them now, against a pool that cannot lose, would make
// the game brutal the moment the economics are fixed. scripts/diagnostics/
// shock-check.ts reports what each event actually costs and asserts nothing
// about whether that is the right amount.

  // THE CATASTROPHE EVENTS — forceEvent, one kind for every regional peril.
  //
  // ⚠ #2 WAS DATA ONLY AND IS NOW EXECUTABLE. Its two blockers were "no cat
  // generator" and "no occurrence tower for a cat event to pierce". Both went
  // with the cat band (propertyCatastrophe.ts, PROPERTY_CAT_MODEL): a regional
  // event summed into ONE occurrence, answered by Property's one $995M xs $5M
  // layer like any other occurrence. A forced event reuses all of it — the
  // occurrence, the catastrophe flag booking reads, development and the claims
  // export — and
  // adds only a named region and a stated size. So wildfire, earthquake,
  // flooding and windstorm are rows of ONE effect kind, not four mechanisms.
  //
  // WHAT CHANGED IN #2's ROW, AND WHY:
  //   - `span: true` and `intensity: 5.3` are gone. The cat band's ruling is one
  //     occurrence per region; a quake reaching an adjacent region is a second
  //     forceEvent, and the matrix row asks for one large Property loss.
  //   - its WC half was `freqMultiplier` on WC, which WC's generator never read
  //     (WC takes componentFreqMultiplier) — it would have fired as a
  //     Property-only event while describing crew injuries. It is now an
  //     explicit WC injection, and shockCatalog below now REJECTS a
  //     freqMultiplier on WC outright.
  //
  // THE SIZE, $25M-$100M, is the matrix's range, drawn uniformly per firing
  // from a stream keyed on the shock id. Against Property's $5M occurrence
  // retention the whole range is ceded above $5M: $20M-$95M per event.
  //
  // THE WC HALVES ARE SHAPES, NOT ONE CLAIM. They were one $9.0M claim for the
  // earthquake and two $900k for the wildfire, borrowed from #15 and #10. A
  // disaster does not injure one worker catastrophically; it injures many
  // ordinarily, or a few badly — and the shape decides who pays. Each claim is
  // its own occurrence (every WC claim is), so below the $1M retention the pool
  // keeps all of it: forty $100k injuries cost the pool everything, where one
  // $9.0M claim was mostly ceded. Both are region-bound to where the event
  // struck, and drawn log-uniformly (see injectClaim in types/shocks.ts).
  // Measured against the natural book (60 default game-years, 33,676 claims):
  // median $1k, 90th percentile $28k, 99th $525k, 99.9th $3.08M; ~58 claims a
  // year fall in $20k-$300k.
  //   earthquake  30-60 claims, $20k-$300k — above ordinary (the 89th-99.4th
  //               percentile band: falling debris, evacuation, clean-up) and
  //               well below the retention; roughly doubles a year's
  //               moderate-injury count. Expected ~$4.6M, all retained.
  //   wildfire    3-6 claims, $300k-$2.5M — the 99th-99.9th percentile band:
  //               firefighters, burns, smoke inhalation. Few and severe, and
  //               ~43% of them cross $1M, so the tower answers the worst.

  //
  // ⚠ RE-TARGETED BY THE WC SEVERITY REBUILD. This used to be a paramOverride on
  // `presumption.ratePer1MPoliceFire` x1.5. The presumption process is retired
  // and that path no longer exists — which would have THROWN AT MODULE LOAD and
  // stopped the app from starting, since paths are validated at import below.
  //
  // A LEGISLATIVE EXPANSION HAS TWO HALVES AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS:
  //
  //   FORWARD — more severe claims are compensable from now on. That is an
  //   ARRIVAL-RATE change on the heavy mixture component, persisting forward
  //   because the event is future-horizon.
  //
  //   RETROACTIVE — conditions that were not compensable when they happened now
  //   are. That ADDS CLAIMS DATED TO PRIOR ACCIDENT YEARS. It is emphatically NOT
  //   "revise the unreported inventory", which would make already-drawn claims
  //   cost more; these are claims that did not previously exist.
  //
  // FORWARD MAGNITUDE, x1.096, DERIVED NOT INVENTED. The retired shock raised
  // presumption frequency 50%, and presumption was 18.26% of CLASS-ONLY loss, so
  // the old event added +9.13% of loss. The heavy component carries ~94.9% of
  // loss, so `k = 1 + 0.0911 / 0.949 = 1.096` reproduces that. (Measured on the
  // class-only base, which is the right one: with presumption retired, all WC
  // loss is now "class" loss and there is no separate channel to exclude.)
  //
  // ⚠ RETROACTIVE MAGNITUDE IS A JUDGMENT CALL — the spec requires the mechanism
  // but sets no number, and the retired event had no retroactive half at all.
  // Sized to mirror the forward rate over a three-year reach-back: 3 claims at
  // $900,000 each, $2.70M against an enrolled annual WC loss near $9.70M, i.e.
  // ~9.3% per year reached back — the same rate as the forward effect. $900,000
  // is the heavy component's ~98.3rd percentile, the right neighbourhood for a
  // serious occupational-disease claim and well below #15's $9.0M mega-claim.
  // DISPLACED BY: any real reach-back window from comparable legislation.
  //
  // ⚠ THE THREE CLAIMS ARE NO LONGER BACKDATED, and the magnitude is unchanged.
  // They carried accidentYearOffset -1/-2/-3 so they would be attributed to
  // prior accident years; with WC's report lag removed there is no mechanism by
  // which a prior-year claim becomes known now — it would have reported in its
  // own accident year. The claims were never inert (emit added them to this
  // year's loss regardless of their label), so what the offset actually bought
  // was an attribution that fed the chain-ladder, and that consumer is gone.
  // Keeping it would have left a field that changes a label and nothing else.
  //
  // The narrative survives intact: legislation makes previously non-compensable
  // conditions compensable, and the claims are FILED ON ENACTMENT. Three claims,
  // $2.70M, in the year the event fires — the same money at the same time.
  //
  // `firstYearOnly` on all three: the event is future-horizon so the frequency

  // THE SOCIAL-INFLATION HARD MARKET. GL's baseline severity trend already
  // carries LONG-RUN social inflation at 2.0%/yr (glClaimEngine's

  // nuclear verdicts, litigation funding, eroding damages caps — running
  // severity toward Swiss Re's 2023 peak of 7% social while it lasts.
  //
  // ⚠ IT IS A RATCHET, NOT A TEMPORARY SPIKE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE MODELLING
  // POINT. Swiss Re's Social Inflation Index has been above zero EVERY YEAR
  // since 2014: when a hard market ends, severity does not fall back: the LEVEL
  // it reached stays. So this is future-horizon and permanent, and its factor is
  // sized as the CUMULATIVE EXCESS an episode leaves behind rather than as a
  // per-year rate. The episode's duration is an authoring-time input to that
  // number, not a runtime mechanic.
  //
  // MAGNITUDE, DERIVED: the excess of the peak over the baseline is
  // 1.07 / 1.02 = 1.04902, i.e. +4.90%/yr while the episode runs. Compounded:
  //     2 years  1.1004      3 years  1.1544      4 years  1.2110
  //
  // TWO YEARS (x1.1004) IS CHOSEN, for two reasons:
  //   1. 7% IS A PEAK, NOT A PLATEAU. Swiss Re's index peaked at 7% in 2023; the
  //      elevated 2017-2022 stretch averaged 5.4%. Holding the maximum observed
  //      value for three or four years asserts a plateau the data does not show.
  //      Two years at the peak is the defensible end of the range.
  //   2. THE RATCHET IS PERMANENT, so even 1.1004 is not a small event. GL's
  //      enrolled gross runs ~$17.8M/yr, so +10.04% is ~$1.79M EVERY REMAINING
  //      YEAR. Firing mid-game that is ~$14M cumulative against a ~$30M starting
  //      surplus — roughly 3.7x the lifetime cost of #22, which is a one-year
  //      +21.7% of line. Hence the `high` band rather than `moderate`.
  //
  // ⚠ WHAT THIS IS NOT, AND WHAT SHOULD REPLACE IT EVENTUALLY: an elevated TREND
  // RATE that runs for N years and then reverts to baseline with the accumulated
  // level retained. That is the physically correct model. It needs a new effect
  // kind (a trend-rate delta with a duration) because the resolver has NO
  // bounded-duration horizon — an effect is either one year (`current`) or
  // permanent (`future`). The ratchet reproduces the END STATE of an episode
  // exactly and only approximates its path, front-loading the whole step into
  // the firing year. Recorded so the approximation is not mistaken for the
  // finished design. See types/shocks.ts on sevMultiplier.
  //
