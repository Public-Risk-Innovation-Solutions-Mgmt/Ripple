// ============================================================================
// RISK CONTROL, AS FIVE CATEGORIES INSTEAD OF ONE INTENSITY DIAL.
//
// ⚠ TWO OF THE FIVE NOW REACH THE ENGINE. THIS FILE IS NO LONGER INERT.
//
// `gl-law-enforcement-analytics` reduces GL CLAIM FREQUENCY on a three-year
// ramp, and `wc-safety-rtw` cuts WC frequency and converts lost-time WC claims
// to medical-only. The mechanisms, the magnitude and the rule for composing with a shock
// live in src/utils/riskControlPrograms.ts; this file still holds only the
// DESCRIPTION — id, name, scope, term, benefit shape — and the engine reads the
// program by id rather than reading these fields.
//
// ⚠ SO `commitmentYears` AND `benefit` ARE STILL DESCRIPTIONS, NOT THE
// SCHEDULE, AND THAT SPLIT IS DELIBERATE RATHER THAN UNFINISHED. The catalog
// says the GL program is three years and `ramped`; riskControlPrograms.ts says
// the ramp is [0, 0.5, 1] and the reduction is 5%. A reader changing
// `benefit: 'ramped'` here changes what the department page SAYS and not what
// the engine DOES. If that ever becomes confusing enough to matter, the fix is
// to derive one from the other — not to duplicate the numbers into this file.
//
// ⚠ AND THE WC ENTRY'S `benefit: 'immediate'` IS NOW ONLY HALF TRUE. Both of
// its levers act from year one, which is what the label says — but safety
// ramps 25/60/100 and RTW 75/100/100. Left as `immediate` because changing it
// changes the department page's text, which this engine change must not do;
// see riskControlPrograms.ts for the real schedule.
//
// THE OTHER THREE ARE STILL DESCRIPTION ONLY. property-mitigation,
// claims-management-system and member-services reach nothing;
// WIRED_PROGRAM_IDS in riskControlPrograms.ts is the list that decides, and it
// has two entries. Which of those a player can COMMIT from a tile is a separate
// list, BUYABLE_PROGRAM_IDS; it has both, each with its own standing and charge.
//
// The older pool-wide control, SLIDER_RANGES.riskControlPct, still exists and is
// still pinned at 0 with no UI behind it. It reaches the draw by a DIFFERENT
// path — riskControlEffectiveness, which scales every line at once — so the two
// mechanisms are independent and both are live in the arithmetic. A future
// commit that retires riskControlPct should say which programs replace it.
//
// WHY IT SHIPS INERT. Risk control reaches the DRAW. Deleting the slider and
// replacing it with boxes that do nothing would remove a working lever and move
// both value baselines for what is, this commit, a display change. Instead the
// slider keeps working and keeps spending while these boxes are rearranged; ONE
// later commit swaps the spend across and removes the slider, and no commit in
// between has to put a lever back.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THE CATEGORIES ARE FOR, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT ONE NUMBER.
//
// A dial says "spend 4% of premium on safety" and cannot express the two things
// that make risk control a real decision for a public-entity pool:
//
//   1. IT IS BOUGHT IN PROGRAMS, NOT IN INTENSITY. A pool commits to a
//      three-year return-to-work program; it does not commit to 4%.
//   2. THE BENEFIT ARRIVES ON THE PROGRAM'S OWN CLOCK. WC safety pays back
//      quickly because WC losses report quickly. Liability losses emerge over
//      years, so law-enforcement analytics cannot pay back in year one whatever
//      is spent. A capital system pays back NOTHING until it is finished.
//
// A single intensity dial collapses all three timings into one, which is what
// makes the current control unteachable: the player cannot get the timing wrong,
// so they cannot learn it.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ MULTI-YEAR COMMITMENTS DEFAULT TO CONTINUING, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
//
// A player chooses to STOP, not to continue. That is how a real program
// behaves — nobody re-signs a safety consultant every January — and it is the
// only arrangement under which abandoning a program partway is a decision the
// player has to actually make rather than one they make by forgetting. The
// opt-out is also where the teaching is: stopping a three-year program in
// year two should cost the years already spent.
//
// NONE OF THAT BEHAVIOR IS BUILT. `commitmentYears` and `benefit` below are
// DESCRIPTIONS for the display, not a schedule the engine runs.

/**
 * ⚠ A PLACEHOLDER. NOBODY CHOSE THIS FIGURE AND IT IS NOT A COST ESTIMATE.
 *
 * $1,000,000 per program per year, IDENTICAL ACROSS ALL FIVE, and the sameness
 * is the tell rather than a finding: a three-year law-enforcement analytics
 * build, a two-year roof-hardening capital project and a yearly training and
 * hotline service do not cost the same amount, and nothing here claims they do.
 * One number was needed so the tiles could show a cost and a total at all.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT QUIETLY ANSWERS A STRUCTURAL QUESTION THAT IS ACTUALLY OPEN. A flat
 * per-program figure asserts that program cost does NOT scale with the book.
 * That is a real modelling choice and it was made by default, not on purpose.
 * Real costs would likely be mixed: some scaling on exposure — a safety program
 * across a bigger payroll costs more to deliver — and some genuinely flat, like
 * a software build whose price does not care how many members use it. Which
 * programs fall on which side is undecided. Replacing this constant means
 * deciding that, not just substituting five numbers.
 *
 * ⚠ IT SAYS SO HERE BECAUSE OF THIS REPOSITORY'S OWN HISTORY. Three constants
 * once arrived in a single commit with no derivation recorded and were still
 * being traced back months later. A placeholder that does not announce itself
 * becomes one of those. This one announces itself.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE FLAT CHOICE IS NOT NEUTRAL — MEASURED, THE BURDEN RUNS BACKWARDS.
 * Because the figure does not scale with the book, the SMALLEST pool pays the
 * MOST in relative terms. Year 1 at defaults, 8 games, the whole available menu
 * against the pool's own premium:
 *
 *   config          programs   menu/yr   total member charge   pool premium
 *   WC only              3       $3M        21.66M  13.8%       10.74M  27.9%
 *   GL only              3       $3M        33.86M   8.9%       13.73M  21.8%
 *   Property only        3       $3M        28.20M  10.6%       14.59M  20.6%
 *   WC+GL                4       $4M        55.53M   7.2%       24.47M  16.3%
 *   all three            5       $5M        83.73M   6.0%       39.06M  12.8%
 *
 * A one-line pool carries more than twice the relative cost of a three-line one
 * for programs it has fewer of. That is the flat-versus-scaling question showing
 * up as a number rather than as a caveat, and it is an artefact of the stand-in,
 * not a designed property.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACES IT: per-program costs in dollars, with the flat-versus-scaling
 * question settled per program and each figure's basis recorded at the entry.
 * Until then, five identical numbers.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE WC PROGRAM IS SIZED AGAINST IT, SO MOVING IT MOVES A DECISION. At
 * RTW 12.5% and $1M/yr, charged by the engine, the WC safety & RTW program nets
 * -$0.10M over five years (SE $0.21M — break-even) and keeps $11.01M over the
 * claims' full life. RTW was raised from 10% to get there, rather than this cost
 * lowered, because this cost has no basis and the effect has a source. A
 * replacement figure materially below $1M turns the program into an obvious yes
 * and one materially above into an obvious no. The table is at
 * WC_RTW_TARGET_REDUCTION in riskControlPrograms.ts. The GL program was measured
 * against it too (0.28x, gl-program-value.ts).
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IS CHARGED. BOTH ARE, EACH WITH ITS OWN CONSTANT, AND NEITHER READS
 * THIS ONE. GL: GL_ANALYTICS_BUILD_ANNUAL_COST for three years, then
 * GL_ANALYTICS_MAINTENANCE_ANNUAL_COST. WC: WC_SAFETY_RTW_ANNUAL_COST, flat,
 * every committed year — people, not a platform, so no maintenance tier. Both
 * equal $1M today because both were sized against this placeholder, and both
 * are equally without a basis.
 *
 * ⚠ THE WC FIGURES ABOVE ARE THE ENGINE'S, NET OF THE CHARGE. The earlier gross
 * arithmetic (+$4.53M - $5M at RTW 10%) understated the cost by the investment
 * income the spent money stops earning — -$1.01M measured against -$0.47M
 * arithmetic — which is why RTW moved to 12.5%.
