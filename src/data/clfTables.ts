// STATIC CLF TABLES for WC, GL and Property.
//
// CLF(p) is the multiplier applied to the pool premium so that the funded
// amount covers the year's retained loss p% of the time.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ READ THIS FIRST: THE THREE LINES DO NOT COME FROM THE SAME PLACE.
//
//   WC        DERIVED  — backtested on this engine. Everything in the derivation
//                        note below applies to it, and its stop labels mean what
//                        they say against WC's own retained distribution.
//   Property  DERIVED  — the same, on the net basis. Added after this block was
//                        first written, which is why it used to say "two lines".
//   GL        SUPPLIED — a real pool's measured curve at a scale this model does
//                        not have. It is IN FORCE for GL, it does NOT describe
//                        GL's own distribution, and it over-delivers by about
//                        15pp through the middle of the working range while
//                        UNDER-delivering by up to 18pp at the bottom of it.
//                        See GL_SUPPLIED below
//                        for the measured cost; GL's own derived curve is kept
//                        beside it as GL_DERIVED.
//
// The derivation note that follows describes how the DERIVED tables were made.
// It is the provenance of WC's and Property's shipped curves and of GL_DERIVED —
// NOT of the GL curve the engine actually reads.
//
// ============================================================================
// HOW THESE WERE DERIVED, AND WHY IT IS A BACKTEST.
//
// The engine is run over many games and years, and for every line-year the
// realised retained loss is divided by the retained loss that was funded:
//
//     ratio = netIncurredLoss / poolPremium
//
// The percentiles of that ratio ARE this table. See
// scripts/diagnostics/clf-table-derive.ts.
//
// ⚠ THE SAMPLE IS DESCRIBED AT EACH TABLE, NOT HERE, BECAUSE IT DIFFERS BY LINE.
// This block used to say "3,000 games x 10 years per line, at ALL-DEFAULT
// decisions, each line SOLO". Solo is still true and still deliberate — inter-line
// loans cannot then couple two lines' derivations, at a cost measured in the
// script's POOLED note. All-defaults is no longer true: the tables are now drawn
// from FOUR new-business appetite arms, because the appetite control is what
// moves the enrolled book, and a table meant to hold across the book's range has
// to be fitted across it. Each table's own header gives its games, arms, band and
// line-year count.
//
// ⚠ THIS REPLACES A MONTE CARLO THAT WAS WRONG IN A WAY ONLY A BACKTEST COULD
// SEE. The previous WC_CLF_GRID and GL_CLF_GRID were derived from a separate
// Monte Carlo of the annual loss distribution and interpolated at runtime on a
// CV (WC) or lambda (GL) axis. Measured against the engine, WC's over-delivered
// at EVERY ONE of nine stops, by +3.5pp at the working stops — a mismatch
// between the grid's model of the draw and the draw itself, invisible to the
// grid's own held-out validation because that check compared the grid against
// its own generating process. Deriving from the engine absorbs any such
// mismatch by construction: there is no second model left to disagree with.
//
// ⚠ NO CIRCULARITY, AND THE APPETITE ARMS DO NOT WEAKEN IT. fundingAtExpected
// pins CLF to exactly 1.000 and no table is consulted, so the derivation run does
// not depend on its own output. The arms vary newBusinessAppetite only; not one
// of them touches the funding flag, so the pin holds on every line-year in the
// sample, not just the default ones.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE NUMERATOR IS netIncurredLoss, NOT netUltimateLoss, AND THE CHOICE MATTERS
// ON WC.
//
// netIncurredLoss is what the P&L charges against the premium —
// underwritingIncome = poolPremium - netIncurredLoss is an exact identity at
// defaults. So "adequate at stop p" means precisely "underwriting income is
// non-negative p% of the time", which is the outcome the player actually
// experiences in surplus.
//
// WC's grossUltimateLoss is the CALENDAR-year REPORTED loss (its own header
// says so): it carries prior-year emergence and excludes this year's delayed
// claims. The two bases give crossings 4.6pp apart on WC (47.2% incurred vs
// 51.8% ultimate) and 1.9pp apart on GL (68.6% vs 70.5%, the gap being reserve
// paydown timing since GL has no IBNR; both are pre-trending-ceiling figures,
// the GL incurred crossing now being 70.9%). Choosing the ultimate basis would have
// made every stop label overstate what the player's surplus does, which is the
// same class of defect the net-funding change removed.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ CALIBRATED AT THE DEFAULT LAYER CONFIGURATION AND THE EQUILIBRIUM BOOK.
//
// TWO SIMPLIFICATIONS ARE BAKED IN, both deliberate and both measured:
//
//   NO LAYER-MASK DIMENSION. The table is measured with DEFAULT_LAYERS_PLACED
//   (every purchasable occurrence layer). Retained-distribution SHAPE is not
//   invariant to the placement — standardising three configurations by their own
//   retained CV does NOT make the curves overlay, and the decisive case is GL,
//   where all-layers CV 0.7794 and no-layers CV 0.7940 sit 1.9% apart while
//   their standardised tails differ by 2.1-2.3x at p80/p90/p95. So a CV-indexed
//   single curve was ruled out on measurement, not assumed. Declining layers
//   costs UP TO ~8.9pp of label accuracy (worst measured: GL no-layers at the
//   90% stop delivers 81.1%). A MASK-INDEXED derivation is the eventual answer
//   if that ever matters — 8 masks per line, applied to the same draws in one
//   pass, not 8 passes.
//
//   NO BOOK-SIZE DIMENSION, AND THE REASON IS NO LONGER "THE BOOK HOLDS STILL".
//   This block used to say the size axis bought little because the book held
//   near 62 members. There is no equilibrium now — the target came out, and the
//   book is an outcome that runs roughly 76 -> 92 enrolled at defaults, reaches
//   97 on Accept All and settles near 64 at the strict appetite bar. One curve
//   was kept anyway, deliberately: a size axis makes the rate move as the book
//   moves, which is a second feedback between membership and pricing on top of
//   the ones already in the engine, and the measured cost of going without one is
//   small. THE RULE IS: each line is derived at the band that CONTAINS ITS OWN
//   MEDIAN BOOK, measured on the played game. WC and GL land in the 72-88 band,
//   Property — whose book runs about eleven members higher — lands in the 88+
//   one. See each table's own note.
//
//   ⚠ WHAT THE SINGLE CURVE COSTS, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSERTED. Deriving at
//   the small, middle and large bands and backtesting each against all three
//   gives the worst label error across the range:
//
//       derived at      WC       GL      Property
//       small ~64     +4.5     +6.5        -9.7
//       mid ~80       -2.7     -4.4        +4.6
//       large ~97     -4.2     -6.3       +10.2
//
//   ⚠ READ THAT TABLE WITH ITS OWN LIMITATION IN VIEW, WHICH IS THAT THE THREE
//   COLUMNS ARE NOT WEIGHTED BY WHERE EACH LINE ACTUALLY SITS. It says the middle
//   is the only row inside 5pp on every line, and that was the first decision
//   taken here. It held for WC and GL and did NOT hold for Property, because
//   Property spends 63% of its line-years in the large band and only 26% in the
//   middle one: a mid-band Property table reads -5.2pp and -7.9pp on those two,
//   i.e. outside tolerance on 89% of the line's own exposure, while scoring +4.6
//   in the unweighted row above. The per-line median-book rule replaced it.
//
//   Deriving at the top was the stated instinct — a factor slightly light on a
//   small book being safer than one heavy on a large one. On WC and GL that
//   instinct costs 4-6pp against the middle's 2-4pp and was not taken. On
//   Property the same instinct IS the answer, for a reason the instinct did not
//   name: not safety, but that the top is where Property's book lives.
//
//   ⚠ AND BOOK SIZE ENTERS AS SHAPE, NOT LEVEL, WHICH BOUNDS HOW BIG THIS CAN
//   EVER BE. The CLF is loss over PREMIUM, and premium scales with the book, so
//   a bigger pool cannot move the curve by being bigger — only by having a
//   differently shaped ratio distribution. Measured, the 50% stop moves 1.6% on
//   WC and 1.9% on GL between a 65-member and a 92-member book. Anyone reasoning
//   that a 1.5x book needs a 1.5x-different factor is reasoning about a level
//   effect that the ratio has already divided out.
//
// ⚠ RE-DERIVE THIS TABLE if DEFAULT_LAYERS_PLACED changes, if the funding basis
// changes again, if the MEMBERSHIP TRAJECTORY moves materially — the band it is
// derived at, not an equilibrium, since there is no longer one — or if any loss
// model is re-fitted. It is a measurement of the engine, so any change to the
// engine's loss or pricing path invalidates it.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THAT TRIGGER FIRED, AND THE RE-DERIVATION WAS MEASURED AND DECLINED. READ
// THIS BEFORE RUNNING clf-table-derive ON THE STRENGTH OF THE RULE ABOVE.
//
// Three commits moved the membership trajectory hard: voluntary departures off,
// the pre-game roster frozen, and No New Business as the default appetite. The
// median book was ~140 at the worst of it and the rule said to re-derive.
//
// ⚠ BUT THE RULE NO LONGER SELECTS A UNIQUE BAND, WHICH IS THE ACTUAL FINDING.
// "The band containing its own median book" assumed ONE trajectory. There are
// now two, and they BRACKET the band these tables are derived at:
//
//     arm                        WC median   GL median   Property median   band
//     defaults (frozen book)        61.5        65.0          66.0        SMALL
//     Open appetite                110.0       112.0         113.0        LARGE
//
// A player who touches nothing sits in SMALL for the whole game; a player who
// opens the bar runs to LARGE. No single curve per line can be derived at "the"
// median because there is no longer one median.
//
// ⚠ AND THE SHIPPED TABLES ARE ALREADY AT OR NEAR THE BEST COMPROMISE, WHICH IS
// WHY NOTHING IS RE-DERIVED. Worst label error per band, each line on the basis
// it is actually gated against (clf-label-backtest-check, 40 games x 4 arms x
// 22 years):
//
//     line (basis)            small ~64    mid ~80    large ~97    derived at
//     WC (calendar)              -4.0        +7.6       +13.0         mid
//     GL (accident-year)        -12.4       -10.1        -8.0         mid
//     Property (calendar)       +20.7 *      -3.1        +3.8         large
//                                             * 223 observations, thin, not gated
//
// ⚠ WC READS BEST AT THE NEW DEFAULT BOOK, NOT WORST, AND THAT INVERTS THE
// OBVIOUS EXPECTATION. Its worst error at the small band is -4.0pp against
// +13.0pp at large. Re-deriving WC onto the default trajectory would improve a
// figure that is already the best of the three and WORSEN the arm that is
// currently failing. Deriving it onto the LARGE band — where the live residual
// is — would hurt the player who touches nothing, who is now the modal player.
//
// GL is monotone the other way (best at large) and its own standing residual is
// at the 30% stop, not at a band. Property is best at mid and large and worst at
// small, but its small band is 223 observations and explicitly not gated.
//
// SO EVERY AVAILABLE RE-DERIVATION TRADES ONE PLAYER'S ACCURACY FOR ANOTHER'S,
// and the file's own measured cost of a single curve — recorded above as
// "derived at small / mid / large" — is exactly this trade seen from the other
// side. The honest answer is that a single curve per line cannot serve a
// trajectory that now spans 62 to 113 members, and the fix is the BOOK-SIZE AXIS
// this file considered and rejected, not a different single curve.
//
// ⚠ WHAT WOULD CHANGE THIS RULING: a decision that one trajectory is the one to
// serve. If the frozen default is what the game is for, derive all three at
// SMALL and accept the active player's error. That is a design call, not a
// measurement, and it is not taken here.
// ============================================================================
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ WC'S TABLE WAS RE-DERIVED WHEN THE REPORT LAG AND IBNR WERE REMOVED, and
// the move went the OPPOSITE way to what was expected. The prediction was that
// removing IBNR would close the 4.6pp incurred-vs-ultimate gap and lift WC's
// crossing from 47.2% toward 51.9%. Measured, it FELL to 44.0% incurred / 47.0%
// ultimate, and the gap narrowed only to 3.0pp rather than closing.
//
// TWO EFFECTS, OPPOSITE SIGNS, and the larger one was not in the prediction:
//   the IBNR BUILD used to inflate netIncurredLoss, so removing it lowers the
//     ratio and lifts the crossing — worth the ~1.6pp of gap that did close
//   the REPORT LAG used to DEFER ~17% of dollars out of each year's reported
//     loss. In a book growing ~2.1%/yr nominal, deferral out exceeds emergence
//     in, so reported loss ran systematically BELOW the accident-year loss the
//     premium was funding. Removing the lag removes that suppression, raising
//     the ratio and lowering the crossing. Mean ratio moved 1.0476 -> 1.0624,
//     +1.5% of premium, against ~1.2% predicted by 17% x (1 - 1.021^-3.5).
// The second dominates, so the crossing fell 3.2pp.
//
// ⚠ IT MOVED AWAY FROM THE ~55% REAL-POOL BENCHMARK, NOT TOWARD IT. That was
// hoped for as a side effect of the removal and did not happen.
//
// The residual 3.0pp incurred-vs-ultimate gap is CASE-reserve rollforward — the
// paydown schedule and the per-cohort development on top of it — which this
// change did not touch. So the gap was never purely IBNR.
//
// (That mechanism was `developmentFactor`, a uniform wobble, when this was
// written. IBNER replaced it, and the gap SURVIVED the replacement at
// essentially the same size — 2.8pp measured on the merged branch, 44.3%
// incurred against 47.1% ultimate. Naming the old mechanism here would now
// point at code that does not exist, and would also imply the wobble was the
// cause when swapping it out did not move the gap.)
//
// ============================================================================
// THE MEASURED CROSSING of the DERIVED curves — where the ratio reaches 1.000,
// i.e. what "Expected" (CLF exactly 1.000) delivers against each line's own
// distribution. AT THE MID BAND, which is where they are now derived:
//
//     WC 48.8%      GL 65.7%      Property 52.8%
//
// ⚠ ALL THREE MOVED AT THE RE-DERIVATION — WC 54.7% -> 48.8%, GL 70.9% -> 65.7%,
// Property 54.0% -> 52.8% — and the two that fell most did so because the curve
// TIGHTENED rather than because the book got worse. A narrower distribution puts
// more of its mass near the mean, so the percentile at which the ratio reaches
// 1.000 moves toward the median from wherever the skew had pushed it. WC and GL
// were both right-skewed by the small-book line-years that are now gone.
//
// The figures below are the PREVIOUS measurements, kept because the reasoning
// that follows them is still the reasoning, and a reader who finds 54.7% quoted
// in another file needs to be able to place it.
//
// ⚠ GL AND PROPERTY WERE MEASURED ON THIS BRANCH TOO AND ARE NOT RE-DERIVED.
// IBNER changes every line's development, so "WC needs re-deriving" is not by
// itself a reason to leave the other two alone — they were measured rather than
// assumed:
//
//   line       table crosses at   measured with IBNER live   inside the table's CI?
//   WC              50.4%            54.7% [54.0, 55.3]        NO — re-derived here
//   GL_DERIVED      70.9%            70.6% [69.9, 71.3]        yes — left alone
//   Property        54.05%           55.0% [54.3, 55.7]        MARGINAL — see below
//
// GL is clear: 70.6% sits inside [70.2, 71.5] and the two intervals overlap
// almost entirely. GL's SHIPPED table is GL_SUPPLIED in any case, which no
// derivation touches.
//
// ⚠ PROPERTY IS THE MARGINAL CALL AND IT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT FOR ITS OWN
// COMMIT. Its point estimate 55.0% sits 0.2pp above the upper bound of its
// table's recorded CI (53.4-54.8), which is the stated trigger for
// re-deriving — but the two intervals OVERLAP across [54.3, 54.8], so the
// evidence that anything really moved is weak. Property has the smallest IBNER
// scale (0.15) and the shortest horizon (2-4), so it is the line IBNER should
// move least, and a 0.95pp shift is consistent with that. Re-deriving it here
// would put two calibrations in one commit and make a later movement
// unattributable to either. If it is re-derived, the literal measured on this
// branch is:
//
//   Property: [0.4590, 0.5384, 0.6053, 0.6686, 0.7276, 0.7826, 0.8372, 0.8901,
//              0.9460, 1.0003, 1.0631, 1.1252, 1.1934, 1.2690, 1.3557, 1.4648,
//              1.6068, 1.8285, 2.0322, 2.3091]
//
// ⚠ WC REACHED 50% WHEN IT STOPPED UNDERCHARGING, and that is the headline for
// every WC figure measured before it. The sequence, all re-derived rather than
// inferred:
//
//   44.1%   with region in severity and one blended pure premium
//   43.2%   region out of severity — NOT a move, the same number re-measured
//           (intervals [43.4, 45.0] and [42.4, 44.1] overlap across most of
//           their width; losses and premium both rose 0.30%, so the ratio this
//           is a percentile of barely shifted)
//   50.4%   four held class rates
//   54.7%   re-derived with IBNER live (this table)
//
// ⚠ THE LAST STEP IS NOT A PRICING CHANGE. WC's premium is identical either
// side of it. The table this branch carried had been derived on
// claims-distribution, where reserve development is the retired uniform wobble;
// IBNER is a different distribution, and a table measured against one engine was
// pricing for another. Re-deriving on the branch's own distribution is the table
// catching up, not the line being re-rated.
//
// ⚠ AND THE MEAN RATIO IS 1.0003. WC is funded at its own expectation to three
// decimal places, and the crossing sits above 50% because the ratio distribution
// is RIGHT-SKEWED — which a compound-Poisson line must be. A right-skewed
// variable with mean 1 has its median below 1 (0.9709 here), so more than half
// of line-years come in under the funded amount. That is the correct shape, and
// WC has not had it before: the sub-50% readings that prompted the whole
// investigation were a funding gap, not a distributional artefact.
//
// ⚠ IT ALSO LANDS ON THE REAL-POOL BENCHMARK recorded below — real public-entity
// pools put the mean year near the 55th percentile, and WC was "about 3pp under
// that". 54.7% incurred, 53.7% ultimate. Not aimed at, and worth not disturbing
// casually.
//
// The +7.2pp is one thing: WC was charging the market's average rate to books
// that were not the market. The median line-year's drawn/funded ratio is now
// 0.9979 — a hair under break-even, where it should sit — against 1.0402 before.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS AN ACROSS-THE-BOARD INCREASE, NOT A REDISTRIBUTION. The median
// enrolled book's blended rate lands 2.3% ABOVE the old single rate, not around
// it, because the books that actually enrol are worse than the full-market
// average. Every WC measurement taken before this — loss ratios, surplus paths,
// crossing percentiles, anything calibrated for playability — was taken against
// a line that undercharged, and none of them transfer.
//
// ⚠ WC's CROSSING MOVED 47.2% -> 44.1% WITH WC_SEVERITY_CAP, outside its own
// old CI, and the direction is the informative part. The cap lowers EXPECTED
// gross loss by 0.32%, but per-layer expected CEDED loss is BIT-IDENTICAL
// (every WC layer bound tops at $50M, below the $85M ceiling — measured, not
// assumed). So E[retained] = E[gross] - E[ceded] falls by MORE than 0.32% in
// relative terms, the pool premium falls with it, and typical realised losses
// fall only on the rare years the cap binds. The ratio therefore rises on an
// ordinary year and "Expected" reaches break-even at a LOWER percentile.
//
// The 3.1pp size is amplified by something already recorded below: WC's
// crossing sits where the ratio density is highest, so a small distributional
// shift moves it a lot.
//
// ⚠ GL's CROSSING THEN MOVED 68.6% -> 70.9% WHEN THE CEILINGS STARTED TRENDING,
// outside its own old CI, and WC's did NOT move at all (44.1% both times, and
// its table shifted only in the 4th decimal). The asymmetry is the diagnostic
// part, so do not read the two as one effect:
//
//   - GL's severity trend is 5.7026% against WC's 3.67%, and its old ceiling
//     was proportionally tighter, so a stationary $100M was truncating far
//     more of GL's later-year tail than $85M was of WC's.
//   - GL's PRICE moved and WC's did not. GL prices at glCappedSeverityTrend,
//     which was BELOW the raw trend and is now equal to it (+2.24% at year 10).
//     WC already priced at its raw trend, so only WC's DRAW moved.
//
// The mechanism behind the 2.3pp: mean and price still match, but the shape
// changed. GL's 99th stop rose 5.6018 -> 6.5251 while its median FELL
// 0.8509 -> 0.8307 — mass moved out of the middle and into the extreme tail,
// because the trending ceiling stops truncating exactly the largest later-year
// claims. A more right-skewed ratio distribution crosses 1.000 at a HIGHER
// percentile. That skew is not a side effect to be tidied away: a fixed ceiling
// lightening a line's tail a little more every year was the defect.
//
// ⚠ GL's SHIPPED crossing is 57.7%, not its derived one, because the supplied
// curve is in force — and the supplied curve did NOT move, so GL's shipped
// pricing is unchanged by the trending ceiling. The derived figure was 70.9%
// when this was written and is 65.7% after the mid-band re-derivation; either
// way it is the truth about GL's distribution and 57.7% is what the supplied
// curve reports. See GL_SUPPLIED.
//
// THE SANITY CHECK AGAINST REAL EXPERIENCE, and it needs the right basis to
// read. Real public-entity pools put the mean year near the 55th percentile.
// WC's ULTIMATE-basis crossing is 51.8% — about 3pp under that, and within 2pp
// of the 54% an independent measurement of the retained distribution's shape
// predicted. Close, not identical, and the residual is not explained here.
// WC's incurred-basis crossing of 47.2% is a further 4.6pp below, and that gap
// is IBNR: the two bases are answering different questions, so the apparent
// disagreement between this backtest and the shape measurement dissolves once
// they are compared on the same one.
//
// GL is expected NOT to match the 55th-percentile benchmark and does not,
// landing at 70.9%. That is structural rather than an error: GL retains 8.0% of
// ground-up loss ABOVE the tower, unhedgeable, against WC's 0.7%. A retained
// distribution carrying a large untransferable spike has a median well below its
// mean, so funding at the mean covers the median year comfortably.
//
// ⚠ BOTH LINES ARE UNDERFUNDED AT CLF 1.000 ON THE INCURRED BASIS: WC by a mean
// 4.8% of premium (mean ratio 1.0476), GL by 2.1% (1.0205). "Expected" funds the
// accident-year expectation while the P&L charges a reserve that grows with the
// book, so the two differ in a growing pool. That is a property of the pure
// premium, NOT something this table should paper over, and it is left visible
// rather than absorbed.
//
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THE TABLE IS SELF-REFERENTIAL, AND IT WAS ITERATED TO A FIXED POINT.
//
// Installing the table changes the engine it was measured from. The route is
// the 90% stop: reserveMarginCLF reads it, the Required Reserve Margin scales
// with it, and runPriorHistory's reject-and-redraw accepted a pre-game only if
// the opening surplus landed inside OPENING_MULTIPLE_BAND x that margin. So a
// first-pass table measured under the old grids sat in an engine with
// different opening surplus than the one it was derived from.
//
// ⚠ THAT ROUTE IS NOW CLOSED, and the iteration record below is kept anyway.
// The pre-game tests the opening against PREMIUM, not against the margin, so
// installing a table no longer moves the opening and the self-reference is
// broken at its only link. A re-derivation from here should converge in ONE
// pass. Confirm that rather than assume it — the fixed-point discipline below
// is what caught the problem in the first place, and it costs one extra run.

// Measured rather than assumed, and iterated until it stopped moving:

//   pass 1 (derived under the retired grids)   WC 49.9%   GL 68.8%
//   pass 2 (derived with pass 1 installed)     WC 47.2%   GL 68.6%
//   pass 3 (derived with pass 2 installed)     WC 47.2%   GL 68.6%   converged
//
// AND AGAIN when the report lag and IBNR came out, which moved WC's whole
// distribution and so required the same iteration from scratch:
//   pass 1 (under the pre-removal table)       WC 44.0%
//   pass 2 (with pass 1 installed)             WC 43.5%   <- SHIPPED
//   pass 3 (with pass 2 installed)             WC 43.5%   converged
// Pass 3 reproduces pass 2 to three decimals at every stop (p50 1.0384 vs
// 1.0385, p90 1.3709 vs 1.3714).
//
// AND AGAIN at the WC severity cap, and AGAIN at the trending ceilings. Both of
// those converged in ONE pass rather than three, and both were CONFIRMED by a
// second run rather than assumed from the note above:
//
//   WC severity cap        pass 1 and pass 2 BIT-IDENTICAL at all 20 stops
//   trending ceilings      pass 1 and pass 2 BIT-IDENTICAL at all 20 stops,
//                          BOTH LINES, crossings 44.1% (WC) and 70.9% (GL)
//                          identical across the two passes
//
// One pass is now the expected outcome, not a lucky one — a3d7760 cut the link
// that made installing a table move the opening book. The second run is still
// worth its two minutes: it is what distinguishes "converged" from "happened to
// land on the same numbers", and it is cheap against re-deriving a table that
// silently did not.
// GL's derived curve re-measured at 68.7% across that change, unmoved — WC's
// report lag never touched it, which is the same thing the GL-solo leak check
// says byte-for-byte.
//
// Pass 3 reproduces pass 2 to three decimals at every stop (WC p50 1.0184 vs
// 1.0187, p90 1.3893 vs 1.3887; GL identical at 0.5397 and 5.6018), so the
// tables below are a fixed point of the engine they sit in, not a snapshot of
// the engine that preceded them.
//
// GL barely moved at any pass; WC moved 2.7pp on the first and then stopped.
// WC's crossing sits where the ratio density is highest, so a small shift in the
// distribution moves the crossing further there than in GL's flat tail region.

// WC — DERIVED from this engine, at the MID BAND of the membership trajectory.
//
// 7,345 line-years falling in the 72-88 member band, drawn from 16,000 across
// 1,600 solo games and FOUR new-business appetite arms, via
// scripts/diagnostics/clf-table-derive.ts (BAND_DERIVE=1 GAMES=400). Enrolled
// book within the band: p10 73, median 79, p90 86. CROSSING 48.8%.
//
// 95% CI half-widths (block bootstrap over whole games) run 0.0042 at the 35th
// stop to 0.0312 at the 99th — tighter through the working range than the
// 30,000-line-year table this replaces, because the sample is less dispersed
// rather than because it is bigger.
//
// ⚠ IT REPLACES A TABLE THAT WAS TOO WIDE, AND BOOK SIZE IS NOT THE WHOLE
// REASON. The previous curve ran 0.6698 to 1.9329; this one runs 0.7913 to
// 1.6030. Re-deriving at a book of 65 — essentially the 62 the old header
// claimed — still gives 0.7903 at the 10th stop, so the old curve's fat lower
// tail is not a size effect at all. It is the DELETED EQUILIBRIUM: the old
// sample was drawn while the book still drifted toward 20 members, and a
// twenty-member pool's loss ratio swings in both directions hard enough to widen
// every percentile. The membership rewrite removed those line-years from the
// population, which is exactly the trigger this file's own re-derivation note
// names.
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ THIS TABLE IS ON THE CALENDAR-YEAR BASIS AND STAYS THERE. RULED.
//
// clf-label-backtest-check measures ACCIDENT-YEAR ultimate as well — did this
// year's claims come in under this year's premium, which is what the funding
// slider's label promises. This curve is percentiles of netIncurredLoss /
// poolPremium, a CALENDAR year, which blends every open accident year at a
// different maturity. It reads -7.0 / -11.0 / -7.5 on the accident-year basis
// and -7.2 / -2.2 / -1.2 on the calendar basis it was built on, and THE GATE
// SCORES IT ON THE LATTER — each line is gated on its own basis, so this curve's
// red is a real residual rather than a definitional one.
//
// ⚠ ITS REMAINING RED IS A BOOK-SIZE LEVEL EFFECT, not a mis-shaped curve. The
// calendar mean ratio runs 1.042 / 1.035 / 1.025 across small / mid / large and
// the worst error tracks it at -7.2 / -2.2 / -1.2: a small book runs a 1.7%
// higher loss ratio, so fewer of its years fall under the low stops. A single
// curve with no book-size axis cannot carry that, which is the cost this file
// already records for shipping one curve per line.
//
// RE-DERIVING WAS COSTED AND DECLINED. It would raise every off-Expected stop by
// 3.2% to 6.0%, and only 16.4% of WC accident years written in a ten-year game
// reach their own runoff horizon before the game ends — WC's horizon is drawn on
// [5, 12]. So a WC curve on settled ultimate charges for cost the player never
// sees land in their own P&L in five games out of six. GL 45.3% and Property
// 71.0% do not have that problem to the same degree.
//
// ⚠ DO NOT READ THE GATE'S WC RED AS A REASON TO RE-DERIVE. Keeping this table
// is the ruling; the -7.2pp that remains is a size effect on its own basis, and
// the EXPECTED_RED entry in scripts/gates.ts separates the two.
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ RE-DERIVED AT THE SMALL BAND. THE DEFAULT GAME IS THE ONE THE LABEL IS NOW
// HONEST FOR, AND TWO OTHER BANDS PAY FOR IT. READ THE COST BEFORE MOVING IT.
//
// The shipped default writes no new business on a frozen pre-game roster, so a
// player who touches nothing plays a book frozen at its opening ~62 for the
// whole game. This table is derived on 6,371 line-years of that band (p10 53,
// median 63, p90 70), crossing 43.0%, across 2,000 games and FIVE appetite arms
// — the fifth being NO_NEW_BUSINESS, added to clf-table-derive and
// clf-label-backtest-check together at 2cf25b1.
//
// ⚠ THE COST, MEASURED RATHER THAN ESTIMATED. The derivation's own candidate
// matrix, worst label error in pp per band:
//
//     derived at      small ~64   mid ~80   large ~97   POOLED

//     large                -20.1    -12.6       +0.0     -10.2
//
// ⚠ THE MID BAND WAS EXACT AND IS NOW OUT OF TOLERANCE, WHICH THE RULING DID NOT
// ANTICIPATE AND WHICH IS RECORDED HERE BECAUSE IT IS THE PART A READER WOULD
// OTHERWISE INFER WRONGLY. This is not error moved from one end to the other: WC
// goes from ONE band outside the 5pp tolerance to TWO. Pooled worst goes +2.2 ->
// +9.9, four and a half times worse.
//
// ⚠ AND POOLED IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE SCORECARD, WHICH IS THE WHOLE RULING.
// The band weights (small 32%, mid 30%, large 38%) come from the five sampled
// arms, and four of those five are settings a player must deliberately opt into.
// They are a SAMPLING choice, not a statement about how the game is played. If
// most sessions run at defaults then the small band carries far more than 32% of
// real exposure and the pooled figure understates the gain. That is a judgement
// about play rather than about the engine, and it was taken explicitly.
//
// WHAT WOULD OVERTURN THIS: evidence that players routinely open the appetite
// bar, which would make mid and large the populations that matter and put this
// table back at mid. Or a BOOK-SIZE AXIS, which is the only thing that serves
// all three bands at once and which this file considered and rejected — see the

//
// ⚠ THE MEASURED PART IS VERBATIM AND IS WRITTEN AT THREE DECIMALS SO THE JOIN IS

// Stops 10 through 40 are extrapolated and carry four decimals. Anything at four
// decimals below 45 is this file's arithmetic, not the pool's measurement.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE FORM, AND THE RULING'S PREMISE ABOUT IT WAS CHECKED AND IS WRONG
// ============================================================================
//
// The extension was ordered "from the curve's own implied CV, which runs 0.24 at
// the bottom to 0.40 at 95% — rising, so a flat extension would understate the
// tail." The rise is arithmetically real and the conclusion does not follow.
//
// ⚠ THE CURVE IS A LOGNORMAL WITH FLAT VOLATILITY, TO FOUR DECIMALS. Fitting
// ln CLF = a + sigma z by least squares over all eleven supplied stops:
//
//     sigma 0.34169    a -0.04963    R^2 0.999897
//     worst absolute error at any supplied stop: 0.0053 CLF points
//
// and a mean-one lognormal would carry a = -sigma^2/2 = -0.05837, so the curve's
// implied mean is 1.00878 — it is normalised to 1 within 0.9%. The local
// volatility d(ln CLF)/dz between adjacent stops reads
//
//     0.351  0.352  0.347  0.350  0.342  0.347  0.339  0.340  0.332  0.336
//
// which is flat, and whose OLS slope against z is -0.0128 +/- 0.0021 —
// SIGNIFICANT, and NEGATIVE. The curve is slightly THINNER-tailed than lognormal
// at the top, not fatter.
//
// ⚠ WHAT RISES IS THE READING, NOT THE CURVE. The 0.24-to-0.40 figure comes from
// (CLF(p) - 1) / z_p, which reads the curve as mean 1 plus z standard deviations.
// That quantity rises for ANY right-skewed mean-one distribution, because the
// mean sits above the median, and a PURE constant-sigma lognormal at the fitted
// sigma reproduces it nearly stop for stop:
//
//     stop      actual (CLF-1)/z      pure lognormal at sigma 0.34169
//       65            0.2258                     0.2218
//       75            0.2980                     0.2939
//       85            0.3454                     0.3434
//       95            0.4037                     0.4069
//
// So a flat-sigma extension does not understate the tail; it REGENERATES that
// rise on its own. The reading is also only defined away from the crossing: at
// the 45% stop it gives 0.72, at 50% it is undefined, and at 55% it is negative.
// The 0.24 in the ruling corresponds to roughly the 65-67% stop, not to the
// bottom of the supplied range.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE EXTENSION
// ============================================================================
//
// FORM: lognormal, because that is what the curve measurably is. ANCHORED at the
// measured 45% value rather than at the fitted line, so the join is continuous by
// construction and no measured stop is overwritten by a fit. CARRIED at the
// volatility measured over the LOWEST supplied span, 45-55, sigma 0.35168, rather
// than the global 0.34169 — because sigma declines with z, so the global value
// would understate the spread at the end being extended.
//
// Implied CV at every stop of the shipped table, both readings, so the extension
// is visibly continuous with the measured part:
//
//   stop     10     15     20     25     30     35     40     45     50     55
//   (CLF-1)/z  .308  .328   .349   .372   .400   .442   .517   .724    n/a  -.056
//   local sigma   -  .3517  .3517  .3510  .3524  .3516  .3515  .3515  .3511  .3523
//
//   stop     60     65     70     75     80     85     90     95
//   (CLF-1)/z  .150  .226   .267   .298   .322   .345   .369   .404
//   local sigma .3471 .3495  .3423  .3473  .3390  .3399  .3316  .3356
//
// The local-sigma row is the continuity that matters: 0.3510-0.3524 across every
// extrapolated interval against 0.3316-0.3523 across every measured one. There is
// no step at the join. The (CLF-1)/z row is discontinuous through the crossing
// and that is a property of the reading, not of the curve.
//
// ⚠ THE 97.5 AND 99 STOPS ARE KEPT, AND THE FIRST ANSWER HERE WAS WRONG. They
// were dropped on the ruling's invitation, on the argument that nothing can
// request them — SLIDER_RANGES.fundingConfidenceLevel is 0.30-0.95 and the only
// other request in the engine is reserveMarginCLF at 0.90, which is exactly GL's
// position. THAT ARGUMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO WC. WC does not read SLIDER_RANGES.
// It has its own WC_FUNDING_CONFIDENCE_RANGE, which is 0.10-0.99 with explicit
// stops at 0.975 and 0.99. Every stop in this table is reachable on WC, at both
// ends, and dropping the top two would have left two slider positions answered
// by a clamp that silently delivers the 95% value under a 99% label. That is a
// far larger error than any extrapolation here could make.
//
// The remaining objection stands and is answered rather than dismissed: the 99th
// stop is 38% of the measured span beyond the data, in the direction where sigma
// is provably declining, so a constant-sigma extension would be knowingly too
// heavy. So the top is carried at the volatility measured over the TOP supplied
// span, 85-95, sigma 0.33400 — the mirror of what the bottom does with the 45-55
// span. That uses what the trend says without extrapolating the trend itself.
// The choice barely matters: the global sigma would give 1.8532 and 2.1003
// against the 1.8487 and 2.0893 shipped, 0.2% and 0.5% apart.
//
// ⚠ AND THE BOTTOM EXTENSION WAS REQUIRED, NOT DESCRIPTIVE, FOR THE SAME REASON.
// The first version of this note called stops 10-25 unreachable and kept them
// only because the ruling asked for the full grid. WC's slider floor is 0.10, so
// all seven extrapolated stops are reachable and the supplied curve's 45 floor
// would have left SEVEN positions on a clamp. The extension is what the table
// needs to answer its own slider, which gl-supplied-clf-check now asserts against
// WC_FUNDING_CONFIDENCE_RANGE rather than against SLIDER_RANGES.
//
// ============================================================================
// WHAT THIS COSTS, MEASURED
// ============================================================================
//
// ⚠ THE COST IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE RULING EXPECTED AND THE NUMBER IS SAID
// PLAINLY HERE BECAUSE IT IS THE THING THAT WOULD OVERTURN THIS. The ruling put
// the curve at "15-20% heavier than the model's own losses justify at the top",
// from the 0.24-to-0.40 reading. On the definition this repo already uses for
// exactly this comparison — (clf75 - clf25) / 1.349 / clf50, the one that
// produces GL's recorded 0.3979 — the numbers are:
//
//     WC_SUPPLIED implied CV      0.3524
//     WC calendar-year CV         0.1975   <- the basis WC is gated on
//     WC_DERIVED implied CV       0.1862
//
// So the supplied curve is 78% heavier than this model's WC, not 15-20%, and the
// derived table it replaces described that distribution to within 6%. FOR SCALE,
// THIS IS NOT THE TRADE GL CARRIES: GL's supplied curve implies 0.3979 against
// GL's own 0.4168, a 5% gap, which is why GL's residual is as small as -9.4pp.
// WC's gap is an order of magnitude wider in relative terms and its residual is
// correspondingly worse. The measured per-band label error is recorded at
// clf-label-backtest-check's EXPECTED_RED entry.
//
// ⚠ AND THE CROSSING MOVES 12.9pp, NOT 7.9pp. The ruling put WC's model crossing
// at 48.6%; the shipped table crosses at 42.92%, because WC_DERIVED was
// re-derived at the SMALL band at 2cf25b1 and that moved it — gl-supplied-clf-check
// records that as the sixth move of a constant it holds as a literal. The supplied
// curve crosses at 55.78% on staticClf's own linear-in-stop interpolation. So the
// move is 42.9% -> 55.8%.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THAT CHANGES IS THE LABEL, NOT THE BEHAVIOUR, AND THE DIRECTION IS THE
// WRONG ONE. fundingAtExpected pins the multiplier at exactly 1.000, so how often
// a pool funding at Expected comes in under budget is a property of the MODEL and
// does not move at all. What moves is what the game TELLS the player Expected
// means. Today that label is right by construction: WC_DERIVED crosses where the
// model crosses because it was derived from that same sample. A supplied curve
// breaks that identity and leaves the label 12.9pp away from the distribution it
// describes. crossingOf already carries this warning for GL; it now applies to
// two lines out of three.

// MEASURED CONSEQUENCE — this curve OVER-DELIVERS against GL's own distribution

// CHANGE RATHER THAN THE CURVE. The recorded row was 35.5 / 47.8 / 59.6 / 70.5 /
// 80.1 / 87.4 / 92.4 / 94.0, peaking at +10.5pp. GL_SUPPLIED itself has never
// been touched. What moved is the distribution it is being marked against: with
// the membership target gone, GL's own retained ratio distribution is far tighter
// (its 99th percentile went 6.53 -> 1.45), so a curve built for a bigger, smoother
// book now sits too WIDE at both ends rather than uniformly too high. The error
// changed shape, not just size — it is now strongly negative at the bottom of the
// range and strongly positive through the middle.
//
// Peak over-delivery is +19.4pp at the 70% stop, and the curve now UNDER-delivers
// badly at 30-40% where it used to over-deliver. Its top stop of 1.701 covers
// 99.9% of GL line-years against GL's own 99th percentile of 1.4523 — so the old
// note that NEAR-CERTAINTY IS NOT PURCHASABLE on this curve has RETIRED ITSELF.
// The opposite is now true: the top of the slider buys more than the distribution
// has to offer.
//
// THE CROSSING MOVES 65.7% -> 57.7% AS DISPLAYED, and the difference is BOOK
// SIZE. Note what does NOT move: "Expected" still covers 68.1% of GL line-years
// in measurement, because it bypasses the table entirely. (That 68.1% is a
// BACKTEST COVERAGE figure, not the crossing; re-measured at this commit it is
// 70.2%, so the displayed 57.7% understates GL's real coverage at Expected by
// 12.5pp. The crossing it is often confused with moved 68.6% -> 70.9% -> 65.7%;
// these are two different quantities and only one was re-derived.) So the
// displayed figure UNDERSTATES GL's real coverage at Expected. GL's derived curve crosses above the supplied one because a pool of
// this size has retained loss that is genuinely more volatile and more skewed
// than the pool the supplied curve came from; a skewed distribution has its
// median well below its mean, so funding at the mean covers more than half the
// years. The supplied curve, from a larger and smoother book, crosses much
// closer to the middle.
//
// ⚠ THE GAP NARROWED FROM 13.2pp TO 8.0pp AT THE RE-DERIVATION, AND NOT BECAUSE
// ANYTHING WAS AIMED AT IT. Deriving at a 72-88 member book instead of a sample
// that still contained the drift toward 20 removed most of the skew that put
// GL's derived crossing at 70.9%. The supplied curve is unchanged, so the whole
// move is on the derived side. The convergence is real and is evidence for the
// frequency argument below — a bigger, less lumpy book does move this model
// toward the supplied curve's shape — but 8.0pp is still a large gap and the
// supplied curve is still a placeholder.
//
// ⚠ RAISING GL'S FREQUENCY WAS NAMED HERE AS "THE REAL FIX" AND IT IS NOT ONE.
// The claim was that more claims per year at the same expected loss lowers the
// annual CV toward the supplied curve's 0.40. The arithmetic is right and the
// direction is wrong, for two reasons that were both measured:
//
//   THE GAP NEEDS CV TO RISE, NOT FALL. The statistic this table describes is
//   not the annual gross loss whose CV is 0.79. On the accident-year basis the
//   labels actually promise, GL's ratio CV is 0.4168 against the supplied
//   curve's implied 0.3979 — already a match. On the calendar-year basis the
//   derivation used, it is 0.1936, LESS THAN HALF the supplied curve. Frequency
//   only ever lowers CV, so it moves away from the target on either reading.
//
//   MEASURED ON THE ENGINE. Severity shrunk threefold with the rate re-derived
//   from the same external anchor — 11.6 claims per member-year against 5.5 —
//   moved GL's per-band error from -18.5 / -21.1 / -21.9 to -22.3 / -22.3 /
//   -24.2. Worse at every band. A Monte Carlo predicted an improvement and had
//   the sign wrong because it modelled the annual aggregate rather than the
//   statistic the gate reads.
//
// THERE WAS NEVER A GAP OF THE SIZE THIS BLOCK DESCRIBES. See the basis note at
// the head of clf-label-backtest-check.ts: the supplied curve describes accident
// years and the derivation measured calendar years, which blend up to eight open
// accident years at different ages and halve the spread. That is the whole 22pp.
// This table is not the fix because there is much less to fix than it says.
//
// RANGE: 25-95, narrower than the derived table's 10-99. No slider change was
// needed: SLIDER_RANGES.fundingConfidenceLevel is 0.30-0.95, and the only other
// request in the engine is reserveMarginCLF at 0.90, so every reachable request
// already falls inside 25-95. staticClf still clamps outside the range, but on
// GL that clamp is unreachable from any UI control.
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ AND IT STAYS. THE CASE AGAINST IT WAS THE GATE'S OWN BASIS, NOT THIS CURVE.
//
// Two routes away from this table were proposed on a 21.9pp label error that
// turned out to be an artefact — the gate scored this ACCIDENT-YEAR curve
// against a CALENDAR-YEAR statistic. On the corrected basis:
//
//   GL_SUPPLIED   -0.5 to +1.7pp from the 70% stop up, -8.8pp pooled worst
//   GL_DERIVED    -16.2pp pooled worst, and worst exactly in the margin-buying
//                 half where this curve is near-exact
//
// Its accident-year ratio CV is 0.4168 against this curve's implied 0.3979 —
// within 5%. The real-pool anchor describes this model's GL almost exactly, and
// installing the derived curve would have replaced the more accurate of the two
// with the less.
//
// ⚠ ONE RESIDUAL STANDS AND IT IS REAL. This curve carries a FATTER LOW TAIL
// than the model produces, so the bottom of the slider promises more
// under-funding than the book delivers: -11.6pp at the 30% stop on a large book,
// against -0.5 to +1.7pp from the 70% stop up. GL is gated on the accident-year
// basis, so that red is a genuine gap between this curve and the distribution it
// describes rather than a basis artefact. Entered in EXPECTED_RED; closing it
// needs a curve with a different low tail, not a re-derivation.

// This is a measured property of the model and must not be lost: it is what
// GL's retained loss distribution actually does at the book the game produces,
// and anyone revisiting the supplied curve needs both to compare. Re-derived at
// the MID BAND alongside WC and Property: 7,680 line-years in the 72-88 member
// band of 16,000 across 1,600 games and four appetite arms, book p10 73 /
// median 80 / p90 86. CROSSING 65.7%, down from 70.9%.
//
// ⚠ ITS TAIL STOPS WERE THIS FILE'S STANDING EXAMPLE OF AN IMPRECISE ESTIMATE
// AND THEY ARE NO LONGER THAT. The previous curve put the 97.5th at 3.3484 and
// the 99th at 6.5251, with a 95% CI half-width of +/-0.28 at the 97.5th against
// WC's +/-0.012; the note here said that was the distribution rather than the
// sample, GL's retained tail carrying the unhedgeable above-tower band. On the
// re-derived curve they are 1.3293 and 1.4523 at half-widths of 0.0180 and
// 0.0220 — a factor of fifteen tighter, and the same order as WC's.
//
// THAT IS TOO LARGE A MOVE TO BOOK AS PRECISION AND IT IS NOT ONE. The old tail
// was measured on a sample that still contained the drifting-to-20 book, where a
// single above-tower GL occurrence lands on a tiny premium base and produces a
// ratio of six. Those line-years no longer exist, so the tail they generated is
// gone with them. The above-tower exposure itself is untouched — GL still
// retains everything over $25M and the excess market still stops there. What
// changed is the size of the denominator it lands on, not the hazard.
//
// ⚠ SO THE OLD 99th STOP IS NOT SIMPLY SUPERSEDED. It remains the right shape
// for a pool small enough that one uncapped occurrence can be six times its
// annual funding, and if the book is ever allowed to run small again this curve
// will understate that end badly. The re-derivation note at the head of this
// file is the mechanism for catching that; this paragraph is why it matters most
// on GL.

// 0.0062 at the 25th stop to 0.0402 at the 99th.
//
// ⚠ A DIFFERENT BAND FROM WC's AND GL's, AND THE RULE IS THE SAME ONE. Each line
// is derived at the band that CONTAINS ITS OWN MEDIAN BOOK. Measured on the
// played game — all three lines active, four appetite arms, ten years:
//
//     line       book p10   median   p90      band derived at
//     WC              61       78     93      mid   (72-88)
//     GL              62       79     94      mid   (72-88)
//     Property        70       91    101      large (88+)
//
// Property's book runs about eleven members above the other two, so the middle
// band is its LOWER TAIL rather than its middle: 63% of its line-years fall in
// the large band and only 26% in the mid one. Deriving it at the mid band was
// tried first, on the reasoning that the middle of the range is the safe place
// to sit, and it put the table away from most of Property's own exposure —
// clf-label-backtest-check read -5.2pp at the mid band and -7.9pp at the large
// one, both outside tolerance, on the 89% of line-years those two bands hold.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS COSTS, STATED RATHER THAN AVERAGED AWAY. On a SMALL Property book
// this curve over-funds by up to +10.2pp at the 25% stop. That band is 7% of the
// derivation sample and 11% of the gate's, and reaching it needs sustained
// strict underwriting on a line whose book otherwise grows — but it is a real
// player choice and the error is real. It is the largest single cost of having
// no book-size dimension anywhere in this file.
//
// ⚠ A GROSS-BASIS TABLE FOR PROPERTY WAS OFFERED AND REJECTED, and the reason
// is the whole point of deriving this one. That candidate curve (crossing
// 65.5%, median 0.7774, CV 0.809) was checked against four candidate bases on
// this engine and reproduces `grossUltimateLoss / grossExpectedLoss` to within
// 2.0% at every stop — matching its mean (1.0053 v 1.0009), CV (0.805 v 0.809),
// median (0.7808 v 0.7774) and skew (1.287 v 1.288). It is a GROSS curve.
// Property funds NET, so installing it would have re-created the very basis
// error a derived table exists to remove, just with different numbers than
// FUNDING_CLF_TABLE's. The net distribution is far tighter — CV 0.434 against
// 0.809 — because the occurrence layer removes the top of every large claim,
// and that is exactly the difference a net-basis table has to capture.
//
// CROSSING 52.8%, down from 54.0%. So "Expected" on Property is a ~53% stop, not
// the 60% the generic FUNDING_CLF_TABLE labelled it — the mislabelling
// measured in scripts/diagnostics/property-clf-basis-report.ts, corrected at
// source and still corrected.
//
// ⚠ PROPERTY IS THE ONE LINE WHOSE CURVE MOVED UP WITH BOOK SIZE, WHICH IS THE
// OPPOSITE OF WC AND GL. Measured across the bands, Property's 50% stop runs
// 0.9705 (small ~64) -> 0.9469 (mid ~80) -> 1.0157 (large ~97), so it is not
// even monotone; WC's and GL's fall steadily as the book grows. Nothing here
// explains that, and it is recorded as unexplained rather than smoothed over.
// Property's loss model is the one that concentrates a year's outcome in a few
// large events, so a bigger book need not diversify it the way frequency-driven
// WC does — but that is a hypothesis with no measurement behind it yet.
//
// VALIDATED OUT OF SAMPLE, which the derivation alone cannot do: a derived table
// is by construction the percentiles of its own sample. property-clf-basis-report
// draws a different population; it was last run against the table this replaces,
// where it found every labelled stop within 0.9pp of what it delivers, +0.1pp at
// the default. ⚠ THAT FIGURE IS NOT RE-MEASURED HERE and should not be read as
// validating the curve below.
// ============================================================================
// ⚠ ALSO CALENDAR-YEAR BASIS, AND ALSO STAYING — for a simpler reason than WC's.
//
// clf-label-backtest-check gates this line on CALENDAR-YEAR, the basis it was
// derived on, where it reads +7.5 (thin, ungated) / +3.6 / +1.2 and PASSES. On
// the accident-year basis it reads +7.9 (thin) / -4.4 / -1.7, and its indicated
// accident-year curve sits between -2.6% and +4.0% of what ships. Property is
// close enough on BOTH bases that re-deriving buys almost nothing, so the basis
// question that decided WC barely arises here.
//
// Property is also the line least exposed to the objection that sank a WC
// re-derivation: 71.0% of its accident years written in a ten-year game reach
// their own horizon before it ends, against WC's 16.4%. If the ruling on WC is
// ever revisited, Property is the cheap half of it.
